thehindu.com,sci-tech,The lowdown on zearalenone in cereals,26-01-2019,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/the-lowdown-on-zearalenone-in-cereals/article26100813.ece,"What is it? Zearalenone is a fungal toxin infesting cereals such as wheat, maize and barley. It attacks crops while they are growing, but can also develop when cereals are stored without being dried fully. While numerous studies document this toxin in cereals across the world, no data existed for India until now. This month, a Journal of Food Science study detected zearalenone in wheat, rice, corn and oats from markets in Uttar Pradesh. The study, by researchers from Lucknowâs Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR), found the substance in 70 of the 117 samples tested. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India does not impose maximum limits for zearalenone, though the European Union (EU) does. Twenty-four of the U.P. samples exceeded the EU regulatory limits of 100-200 mcg/kg of cereals. Based on this, the authors say India should set limits on zearalenone in cereals. âIt is definitely a worry,â Mukul Das, a food toxicologist at the IITR and an author of the study, told The Hindu . How did it come about? Fungal toxins are commonly found in food, and can be a public health concern, says Vasanthi Siriguri, a researcher at Hyderabadâs National Institute of Nutrition, who was not involved in the study. India regulates the levels of some of these, including aflatoxin, deoxynivalenol, ergot and patulin. The first three infest cereals, while patulin is found in apples. Each of these toxins has been associated with disease outbreaks. For example, in 1974, a hepatitis outbreak in Rajasthan and Gujarat, which made 398 people sick and killed 106, was linked to aflatoxin in maize. Meanwhile, chronic aflatoxin consumption has been shown to cause liver cancer. Given this, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies aflatoxin as a Group 1 carcinogen, meaning there is enough evidence for its carcinogenicity. In zearalenoneâs case, there is no strong evidence of toxicity in humans so far, though several research groups are investigating, says Dr. Siriguri. As a result, the IARC classifies it as a Group 3 carcinogen, which means evidence is not sufficient for an evaluation yet. Why does it matter? Zearalenone behaves like oestrogen, the female sex hormone, and could cause endocrine disturbances in humans. Its nasty effects in animals, such as pigs, are documented. When fed with mouldy corn, pigs develop inflamed vaginas, infertility and other symptoms. This is why countries like Brazil regulate zearalenone levels in animal feed. In humans, the data are fuzzier. It is probably dangerous to humans too, but to be certain, we need to know how much humans consume, how it is metabolised, and how exposure is correlated with disease. Some experiments suggest its ill-effects: in one, when oestrogen-sensitive breast cancer cells were exposed to the chemical in a lab, they proliferated. In 2014, a Tunisian case-control study found a correlation between a zearalenone metabolite in urine and breast-cancer risk in women. But other studies did not find similar links. In the Journal of Food Science study, Dr. Das and colleagues also looked at National Sample Survey Office data on Indian diets to calculate how much zearalenone people could be consuming. They found that average daily consumption through wheat and rice was 0.27 and 0.3 mcg/kg of body weight â higher than the EU limit of 0.25 mcg/kg. In highly contaminated samples, exposure could be as high as 16.9 times the EU limit. What next? Dr. Siriguri says more data are needed from cereals in other States, and from other storage conditions, before India decides to set limits. Since zearalenone favours cool climates, such contamination could be limited to a few States. Also, strong epidemiological data linking human zearalenone levels with diseases such as breast cancer are important. The paper is an excellent starting point, since nothing was known about the chemical in India so far. It is time to build upon it.",,"Background:

thehindu.com,national,Are women in Karnataka consuming an excessive amount of iron?,21-02-2019,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/are-women-in-karnataka-consuming-an-excessive-amount-of-iron/article26327738.ece,"While the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) has pointed out that the overall prevalence of anaemia in Karnataka among women is 51.2%, the risk of inadequate or excess iron intake after fortification of a single food staple and supplementation is not more than 3%. While the reduction of risk of dietary iron inadequacy is adequate, there is nonetheless a small proportion of women who would be at risk of excess intake and this is not ideal, according to a recent study published in the Journal of Nutrition . According to the study, the revised estimate of 15 mg per day comes from transparent calculations that take into account iron loss and absorption by the body and the likely dietary intake varying across States. An Indian Council of Medical Research expert group had in 2010 recommended a daily iron intake of 21mg per day for women of reproductive age â between 15 and 49 years. The current estimate of iron requirement is lower by 6 mg per day, meaning that the risk of dietary iron deficiency could be lower than previously thought. The study also compared these dietary risks with blood biomarker-based estimates of iron deficiency. The study titled âRevisiting Dietary Iron Requirement and Deficiency in Indian Women: Implications for Food Iron Fortification and Supplementationâ, has found that the average daily iron requirement for Indian women in the reproductive age is 15 mg and not 21 mg as currently assumed. It also calculated the risks and benefits of the current iron fortification and supplementation programs. Based on these estimates, the team of researchers led by Anura V. Kurpad from St. Johnâs Research Institute, Bengaluru has cautioned that fortification coupled with supplementation may expose varying but significant proportions of women in 24 States or Union territories to the risk of an excessive iron intake. âThe tolerable upper limit for women of reproductive age is 45 mg per day. Prolonged exposure to iron above this limit could put women at risk of experiencing symptoms such as gastric acidity, constipation, oxidative (physiological) stress or changes in their gut bacterial profile,â Dr. Kurpad told The Hindu . Under the revised estimate, the study predicts that the proportion of women exposed to excess iron under fortification and supplementation would range from 54% in Rajasthan and 15% in Uttar Pradesh to 2% in Bengal, 1% in Goa and Kerala, and 3% in Karnataka. Dr. Kurpad, who also heads the Scientific Panel on Nutrition and Fortification at Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), said FSSAI has set standards for iron fortification of salt and rice, which are relevant in southern States, and salt and wheat which are relevant in northern States. Each of these staples, when fortified, could provide an additional 10 mg of iron per day. âWith Karnatakaâs low risk of dietary iron inadequacy when just one staple food is fortified, along with the iron and folic acid (FA) supplementation being provided under the National Iron Plus Initiative (NIPI) for anaemia control program, it would suffice if just one of the two food staple commodities â either salt or rice â is fortified,â Dr. Kurpad said, stressing on the need for a âprecision-based approachâ. However, gynaecologists in Karnataka said risk of excess overall iron intake is not an issue among women. Hema Divakar, Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI) ambassador to International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), attributed this to low absorption levels mainly because of flouride contamination in water, rampant problem of chronic intestinal inflammation in women and the habit of drinking tea and chewing supari (beetel nut). Countering this, Dr. Anura Kurpad said, âWe are talking about a habitual daily iron intake. When iron is given as a treatment, one balances the risks versus the benefit in severely anaemic women.â",,"Background:

All that mattered was that it was tasty and interesting,â she says.As a mother of three young children though, Renuâs attitude today to the pani puri stalls, which have mushroomed around Kochi, is quite different.âNow I am concerned about the oil, the fact that they donât keep the ingredients covered and that they probably reuse leftovers,â she says.Adding to such concerns of consumers like her, in a recent incident at an outlet in Tripunithura which serves the popular north Indian street-side snack, a woman had vomited immediately after eating it. It prompted the food safety department to conduct raids in outlets in the area. Food safety officer Rani Chacko says that while they conducted a raid at the outlet over consumer complaints of stale pani puri being served, the officers did not find anything seriously wrong. âAccording to the discretion of the officers, if we feel it is a small issue, as a first step we give a rectification notice. The defects we have pointed out to them have to be tackled in a day before we give them the permission to operate again,â she says.The food safety department does not have a record of how many such âpetty retailersâ operate or under what conditions and they take action only if an incident is brought to their notice.Around the city, at around 4 pm as pani puri sellers begin to set up their carts, they already have a clientele waiting.

It is a very hand-intensive operation; the puri is popped, filled and dipped into the water by the vendor.Die-hard pani puri fans, such as media entrepreneur Jayakrishnan G Pillai who treats his team to pani puri at the stalls, say customers are not here for healthy food. âI grew up in Mumbai and Gujarat, so I feel mentally prepared for a slight lack of hygiene. In Kerala, because we are not used to it, it feels problematic,â he says, adding he suffered food poisoning once from the food, but it did not put him off for long.Freelance dietician Fiza Nawaz, who did a thesis and documentary on the street food vendors of Kochi, says that she had drawn up a list of risk factors in street food in general and those specific to pani puri and chat stalls. On top of the list were that stalls were located near garbage dumps and the water for washing utensils was not from a tap but from buckets, which meant it was most likely being reused.âWe sent some samples to the lab and found an alarmingly high count of microbes, particularly the staphylococcus aureus, which in high quantities bring on the symptoms of food poisoning,â she notes. She adds that though the food is handled a lot by hand, when the vendor fills the puri with potatoes and the sweet and tangy water, they are not aware of how to use gloves. âThey donât know that the gloves are only for handling the food. Instead, they make the pani puri with it and also handle other things, which destroys the purpose of using gloves,â she points out.Amit Sarkar , who runs an upscale eatery in Kochi, says that when he and his brother, Sourabh got into the business, one of the things they looked into keenly was hygiene because they are aware of how it is lacking in the stalls, and towards that end they are cautious about the oil, dough, water and the ingredients they use as fillings and storage. To up the ante, they have introduced an automatic pani puri machine, which allows the customers to fill their puris and cuts out the chances of contamination from a third person.âAlmost 60% of vendors buy their puri from one supplier and when we bought from them, we found that it was not very clean and it was high in gluten content, so we started making our own,â says Amit, adding jokingly that his teenage niece prefers the roadside pani puris which are handmade by vendors.Munna Yadav , who started his pani puri outlet over two decades ago, says the food is freshly made and leftovers are thrown away. The puris are fried at about 10 am while the other ingredients are made just before the stall is set up at 3 pm. He sells a plate of six at `20 and gets through 800 puris in a day.Rani Chacko says that though there are no written guidelines for street food vendors, the department is planning a âstreet food hubâ programme, which is in the initial stage, and seeks to identify street food vendors, audit and designate and identify their areas of working. Awareness programmes will also be conducted for them.","In Kochi, concerns about hygiene arise at pani puri outlets due to unhygienic practices such as reusing leftovers and poor storage conditions. A recent incident of a customer vomiting after consuming pani puri led to food safety raids, but no serious issues were found. The food safety department takes action only upon notice of incidents and does not maintain records of 'petty retailers'. Freelance dietician Fiza Nawaz found high counts of microbes, particularly staphylococcus aureus, in samples taken from pani puri stalls, posing a risk of food poisoning.","Background:

But, in most cases, hygiene is given a go by. Customers have no way of knowing if the ice cubes are sourced from manufacturing units functioning in hygienic conditions. The handling of the broken ice by the sellers is another grey area. âContamination of ice used in shops cannot be ruled out,â said Designated Officer for Food Safety Chitra. âA number of temporary shops have sprung up and department officials will fan out to conduct checks on the quality of ice used for making cool drinks.â Ice is made with fresh water.

That is not the case. The Food Safety department is prepared to take action on public complaints of incidences of illnesses caused by unhealthy handling of ice, Dr. Chitra said. Leave alone handling of ice cubes by sellers, suppliers drag the ice slabs before breaking them and filling the crushed pieces in thermocol boxes. Last year, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) issued guidelines for differentiation between edible ice made with potable water and non-edible ice made with non-potable water. In order to prevent misuse of non-edible ice as edible ice, FSSAI issued directions to Food Safety Commissioners of all States that food colour (indigo carmine or brilliant blue up to 10 ppm) must be used in production of non-edible ice.","Unhygienic handling and sourcing practices of ice used in cool drinks at temporary outlets in urban locations have raised health concerns, as confirmed by the Designated Officer for Food Safety, Dr. Chitra.
