The customers were mislead as “cooking medium” is printed in very small text, which was probably overlooked by the consumers,” said Pannu, adding that such deception is punishable offence under the law.Pannu also said desi ghee, which cost at least Rs 350 per kg, is adulterated with vanaspati and palm oil, and is being sold as ‘lite medium ghee’ that is worth only Rs 40 per litre. A couple of cases of misbranding were also reported from the field, informed Pannu.Pannu said the consumers should be on guard against misbranding, substandard and misleading products and check the label before buying the products.Since the launch of Mission Tandrust Punjab in June 2018, food and drug commissionerate officials have been cracking down on adulterators in the state. They have been conducting quality checks on food items on a daily basis.The punjab food safety commissioner had last week said that equipment worth Rs10 crore were installed at the food safety laboratory in Kharar curb ghee adulteration."

The consignment was seized before it could reach its destination for adulteration and packaging.“Our team received information about foreign nationals carrying drugs,” said ANC head DCP Shivdeep Lande .“Our Bandra unit laid a trap and nabbed two persons, Daniel Ezieke, 38, and John Fransis, 35, in front of a high school in Andheri ’s Amboli area. Frisking them and checking their luggage, we found 505g of cocaine on Ezieke and 500g on Fransis.”An interrogation of the accused revealed two trafficking methods used by their syndicate: importing drugs by using flyers, and getting them by post. The trafficked drug is always highly potent. “After it reaches India, it is handed over to local contacts, who keep the consignment at a safe place for some time before passing it on for mixing with other materials. Usually, 1kg of pure cocaine after adulteration becomes 4-5kg. It is then packed in sachets, ready for sale to end users,” said an official.The police said they are yet to recover the passports of the Nigerian nationals to find out for how long have they been in India. “They have been giving evasive replies and frequently changing their version. It’s taking time to interrogate them and corroborate the extracted information,” said an officer.The seized consignment will be sent to the Kalina forensic science laboratory for chemical analysis. “We are interrogating them to find out from which country did they import the drugs and who all are part of their syndicate,” said a senior police officer. The police are also looking into the possibility of locals being involved in the racket."

Health Department sources pointed out that there could be waterborne disease outbreaks if the quality of water was not checked properly. Many areas in the district are already in the grip of water scarcity, where the situation could be alarming. FSSAI licence is a must to distribute drinking water. The sources of collecting the water should be examined to ensure hygiene. The tankers, coated with bitumen or other prescribed material, should be cleaned properly and those who handle the water should be medically fit for the job. Those vehicles should not be used for other purposes too. Criminal offence Those who depend on tanker lorries for drinking water should ensure that the distributor has the licence to do so. To sell food stuff without FSSAI licence is a criminal offence with a fine up to₹5 lakh and a six-month jail term. People can call 8943346191, 8943346611 or the toll-free number 1800 425 11 25 to register complaints over the issue. Bacterial contamination There is also the possibility of bacterial contamination of food in hotels and restaurants and hostels. The food prepared in the morning becomes stale within five to six hours in summer. It has been found to be preserved till the night or heated up and served to the customers. In the Malabar region, the Health Department can take action against those selling such food under the Madras Public Health Act, 1939. The FSSAI instructions are also applicable to food exhibitions and food festivals that have opened in different parts of the district. The sellers should have FSSAI licence and the food should be kept clean, say the guidelines. The FSSAI guidelines also make it clear that vendors of packaged drinking water and soft drinks should not expose them to direct sunlight or exhibit them. Those who distribute drinking water by 20-litre cans should ensure that they are cleaned regularly and avoid using old or damaged cans."

(File photo) CHANDIGARH: According to the 2012 dog census, there were 7,847 stray dogs and 9,824 domestic dogs in Chandigarh. The study was done by a group of scientists from Norway to determine the presence of gastrointestinal parasites in dogs’ faecal samples obtained from recreational parks in Chandigarh.The study found moderate prevalence of Giardia cysts—which can cause parasitic infection in the intestine of dogs. The infection can be transmitted to humans from contaminated ground or water.The study, “Not just a walk in the park: Occurrence of intestinal parasites in dogs roaming in recreational parks in Chandigarh, Northern India,” by Kjersti Selstad Utaaker, Kristoffer Relling Tysnes, Marie Myklatun Krosness and Lucy J. Robertson from Department for Food Safety and Infection Biology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Norwegian University of Life Sciences, has been recently published in the journal, “Veterinary Parasitology. ”Prevalence of Giardia cysts in dog faeces was found to be lower in more affluent areas of the city. “It was found that the prevalence of Giardia was higher in the winter than in the monsoon. We assumed that contamination and the risk of infection would be higher in the wetter season,” said Prof Robertson.A total of 212 samples of dogs’ faecal matter was collected from 10 parks in the city located in Sectors 45, 34, Panjab University, Sector 11 and Sector 9. It was found that dog faeces contaminating parks in Chandigarh does not usually contain parasite transmission stages that pose a significant risk to humans. However, the study highlighted the importance of minimizing contamination of public parks with dog faeces.Among the 212 samples, Giardia cysts were present in 23.1% samples. The prevalence was significantly higher in the winter than in the monsoon, whereas helminth-egg prevalence was unaffected by season.Results suggested that faecal samples contaminating parks in Chandigarh do not usually contain parasite transmission stages posing a significant risk to human health. However, researchers mentioned that parks in Chandigarh should be cleaned regularly, the stray dog population should be controlled, and dog owners should be strongly encouraged to take responsibility for clearing up after their dogs.However, the Municipal corporation officials in the past have claimed that its not easy to sterilise all the dogs. The number of stray dogs has gone up to 14,000 and just 11,000 have been sterilised."

FDA officials collected 15 samples of dal, rice, milk, and other raw materials used for cooking at the Chembur-based adoption home on December 26, the day five-month-old orphan Khushi died in Zen hospital. The next day, nine-month-old Jaydeep died in Kohinoor hospital. Four others, aged less than a year and a half, were hospitalised. Three of them required intensive care support. Story continues below this ad “Out of six children who took ill, only four had similar symptoms of loose-motions and vomiting,” said an FDA official. “If milk or food was adulterated or poisoned, then all children should have fallen ill. Their immunity is low at this age and adulterated food has same impact on every child,” he added. FDA also inspected the milk pouches procured by the adoption home from Aarey Colony and found them intact, indicating no adulteration. It will submit its findings in 10 days. FDA officials also noted that children fell ill in different time intervals. On night of December 23, a baby fell ill and started vomiting. He was admitted on December 24. On December 25, Khushi suffered from fever, and succumbed the next day. On December 26, other children fell ill and were rushed first to Zen and later to Kohinoor hospital. “Khushi’s medical records show she was hospitalised twice in last three months. She had no symptoms of food poisoning when she died,” a food inspector said, adding, “Jaydeep’s case is however surprising. He suffered loose-motions and vomiting.” His symptoms were mirrored by three other children. Story continues below this ad “We suspected he suffered from a gastro problem. But both the deaths may not be related to one another,” the FDA official added. Bal Anand is a privately funded adoption centre running since 1984 in Chembur.

Officials at the adoption centre informed that water is filtered and boiled before children drink it. An inquiry by the Child Welfare Committee is also underway.

He said the State Food Safety Authority had issued directions to all the District Collectors to implement the project by March 1. Kollam leads the way Mr. Khelkar said Kollam was perhaps the first district in the country where not less than 90% of the Food Business Organisations (FBO) had obtained licence from the Food Safety Authority. Joint Commissioner of Food Safety K. Anilkumar said the successful implementation of food safety norms during the Attukal Pongala in Thiruvananthapuram was a major achievement in this regard."
thehindu.com,sci-tech,The lowdown on zearalenone in cereals,26-01-2019,https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/the-lowdown-on-zearalenone-in-cereals/article26100813.ece,"What is it? Zearalenone is a fungal toxin infesting cereals such as wheat, maize and barley. It attacks crops while they are growing, but can also develop when cereals are stored without being dried fully. While numerous studies document this toxin in cereals across the world, no data existed for India until now. This month, a Journal of Food Science study detected zearalenone in wheat, rice, corn and oats from markets in Uttar Pradesh. The study, by researchers from Lucknow’s Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR), found the substance in 70 of the 117 samples tested. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India does not impose maximum limits for zearalenone, though the European Union (EU) does. Twenty-four of the U.P. samples exceeded the EU regulatory limits of 100-200 mcg/kg of cereals. Based on this, the authors say India should set limits on zearalenone in cereals. “It is definitely a worry,” Mukul Das, a food toxicologist at the IITR and an author of the study, told The Hindu . How did it come about? Fungal toxins are commonly found in food, and can be a public health concern, says Vasanthi Siriguri, a researcher at Hyderabad’s National Institute of Nutrition, who was not involved in the study. India regulates the levels of some of these, including aflatoxin, deoxynivalenol, ergot and patulin. The first three infest cereals, while patulin is found in apples. Each of these toxins has been associated with disease outbreaks. For example, in 1974, a hepatitis outbreak in Rajasthan and Gujarat, which made 398 people sick and killed 106, was linked to aflatoxin in maize. Meanwhile, chronic aflatoxin consumption has been shown to cause liver cancer. Given this, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classifies aflatoxin as a Group 1 carcinogen, meaning there is enough evidence for its carcinogenicity. In zearalenone’s case, there is no strong evidence of toxicity in humans so far, though several research groups are investigating, says Dr. Siriguri. As a result, the IARC classifies it as a Group 3 carcinogen, which means evidence is not sufficient for an evaluation yet. Why does it matter? Zearalenone behaves like oestrogen, the female sex hormone, and could cause endocrine disturbances in humans. Its nasty effects in animals, such as pigs, are documented. When fed with mouldy corn, pigs develop inflamed vaginas, infertility and other symptoms. This is why countries like Brazil regulate zearalenone levels in animal feed. In humans, the data are fuzzier. It is probably dangerous to humans too, but to be certain, we need to know how much humans consume, how it is metabolised, and how exposure is correlated with disease. Some experiments suggest its ill-effects: in one, when oestrogen-sensitive breast cancer cells were exposed to the chemical in a lab, they proliferated. In 2014, a Tunisian case-control study found a correlation between a zearalenone metabolite in urine and breast-cancer risk in women. But other studies did not find similar links. In the Journal of Food Science study, Dr. Das and colleagues also looked at National Sample Survey Office data on Indian diets to calculate how much zearalenone people could be consuming. They found that average daily consumption through wheat and rice was 0.27 and 0.3 mcg/kg of body weight — higher than the EU limit of 0.25 mcg/kg. In highly contaminated samples, exposure could be as high as 16.9 times the EU limit. What next? Dr. Siriguri says more data are needed from cereals in other States, and from other storage conditions, before India decides to set limits. Since zearalenone favours cool climates, such contamination could be limited to a few States. Also, strong epidemiological data linking human zearalenone levels with diseases such as breast cancer are important. The paper is an excellent starting point, since nothing was known about the chemical in India so far. It is time to build upon it."

At a meeting called by the Health Department here on Monday, industry stakeholders said they were willing to join the State’s safe food initiative, if the technology to reduce trans fat, sugar and salt content in foods were made available to them. While the details of the action plan are yet to be finalised, the World Bank has expressed its willingness to transfer alternative technologies to the State. Bakers’ association representatives said they would move to trans fat-free alternatives in baked goods, if they did not affect the taste and consistency of their products. Pricing of products was another concern. The top-end bakers had already switched to margarine, which was either low in trans fat or was trans fat-free, in baked goods but this option was unaffordable to most small-scale operators. Representatives of the pickle and papad manufacturers said the high salt content in these foods was to prevent contamination and enhance shelf life. However, good manufacturing practices and hygiene practices can bring down salt content in pickles by 8-10 %. Self-regulation now Commissioner of Food Safety Rathan Kelkar said the State wanted the food industry to self-regulate. Enforcement would only come later. The Health Department has launched the trans fat-free drive as part of the non communicable diseases (NCD) control project as there is ample evidence now that unhealthy diet is a major factor pushing up metabolic syndrome and premature deaths due to lifestyle diseases among Keralites."

They were seized from different wholesalers and retailers in the recent months. Besides seizing these products from outlets being run by a few North India-based traders on the Big Bazaar Street, Jaffer Sha Street and Nadu Gujjili Street, the Food Safety Department officials also seized the banned products from their godowns and residences. The cost of gutka and panmasala products, which are to be burnt shortly on the outskirts of Tiruchi, is estimated to be around ₹10 lakh. The seized products have been kept in a locked room of an office for about six months, pending decision on whether to bury or burn them. Since it was argued that anti-social elements or traders could retrieve the banned products from the buried spot, the officials have now decided to burn them. R. Chithra, Designated Officer, Food Safety Department, Tiruchi, told The Hindu that the issue had been taken to the notice of the Collector, seeking his permission to burn them. Based on it, the banned products would be burnt and a remote area at Panjapur would be chosen for burning the tobacco products. She said that manufacture, storage and sale of chewable forms of tobacco, including gutkha and panmasala products, were banned by the State government in 2013. Tough action would be taken against those selling or possessing them. Surprise raids would be taken in different parts of the district and Food Safety Inspectors have been asked to closely watch the activities of wholesale and retail traders of panmasala, Dr. Chithra added."

The destroyed tobacco products were seized in the raids conducted by the food safety department and police in Gujili Street, Kammala Street and Palakkarai areas in the city since August 2018.The seized products were stored in the premises of the food safety department near Kajamalai in Trichy.The latest seizure was nearly 4 tonne of banned gutka and tobacco products on January 21, 2019, and arrested 2 people for stocking it at a godown illegally. The officials found that they played a major role in supplying the banned items to the retail shops who sell them clandestinely.Sources said that the raids at the godowns and the subsequent seizure will increase the retail price of the tobacco products. Though Tamil Nadu government led by chief minister J Jayalalithaa had put a ban on chewable tobaccos in 2013, the prevalence of the products remained unstoppable even after six years despite the officials taking action on the violators. The officials pointed out the demand among tobacco lovers.As far as Tamil Nadu was concerned, the officials said that the banned items were being transported to the state through Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri , said an official on the condition of anonymity.Whenever the officials carry out the raids at the godowns and retail shops in Trichy, there will be less activity of the violators.

Some grama panchayats too have sought stern action against eateries found violating safety norms. In Thiruvambady panchayat, checking squads have already exposed several local traders who carried out food business without proper licences. During a recent inspection, contaminated food items were seized from a few outlets. Panchayat authorities said the traders were asked to obtain proper trade licences within a week to avoid further legal action. With summer around the corner, the local administrators have noticed a spurt in the number of roadside juice shops, which are suspected of using impure water and utensils. Food Safety officials said they would carry out regular checks to cover maximum number of restaurants, juice parlours and wayside eateries. Vigil had been intensified across the district in the wake of some incidents of food poisoning, they added. As part of tightening of rules in the sector, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) licence has been made mandatory for all types of food supply. The FSSAI registration will be required for those coordinating the supply of food as part of rituals in temples, mosques and churches. Food Safety Department officials said they had organised a registration camp for those who wanted to obtain FSSAI registration for supplying food in religious places."

thehindu.com,national,Are women in Karnataka consuming an excessive amount of iron?,21-02-2019,https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/are-women-in-karnataka-consuming-an-excessive-amount-of-iron/article26327738.ece,"While the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4) has pointed out that the overall prevalence of anaemia in Karnataka among women is 51.2%, the risk of inadequate or excess iron intake after fortification of a single food staple and supplementation is not more than 3%. While the reduction of risk of dietary iron inadequacy is adequate, there is nonetheless a small proportion of women who would be at risk of excess intake and this is not ideal, according to a recent study published in the Journal of Nutrition . According to the study, the revised estimate of 15 mg per day comes from transparent calculations that take into account iron loss and absorption by the body and the likely dietary intake varying across States. An Indian Council of Medical Research expert group had in 2010 recommended a daily iron intake of 21mg per day for women of reproductive age — between 15 and 49 years. The current estimate of iron requirement is lower by 6 mg per day, meaning that the risk of dietary iron deficiency could be lower than previously thought. The study also compared these dietary risks with blood biomarker-based estimates of iron deficiency. The study titled ‘Revisiting Dietary Iron Requirement and Deficiency in Indian Women: Implications for Food Iron Fortification and Supplementation’, has found that the average daily iron requirement for Indian women in the reproductive age is 15 mg and not 21 mg as currently assumed. It also calculated the risks and benefits of the current iron fortification and supplementation programs. Based on these estimates, the team of researchers led by Anura V. Kurpad from St. John’s Research Institute, Bengaluru has cautioned that fortification coupled with supplementation may expose varying but significant proportions of women in 24 States or Union territories to the risk of an excessive iron intake. “The tolerable upper limit for women of reproductive age is 45 mg per day. Prolonged exposure to iron above this limit could put women at risk of experiencing symptoms such as gastric acidity, constipation, oxidative (physiological) stress or changes in their gut bacterial profile,” Dr. Kurpad told The Hindu . Under the revised estimate, the study predicts that the proportion of women exposed to excess iron under fortification and supplementation would range from 54% in Rajasthan and 15% in Uttar Pradesh to 2% in Bengal, 1% in Goa and Kerala, and 3% in Karnataka. Dr. Kurpad, who also heads the Scientific Panel on Nutrition and Fortification at Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), said FSSAI has set standards for iron fortification of salt and rice, which are relevant in southern States, and salt and wheat which are relevant in northern States. Each of these staples, when fortified, could provide an additional 10 mg of iron per day. “With Karnataka’s low risk of dietary iron inadequacy when just one staple food is fortified, along with the iron and folic acid (FA) supplementation being provided under the National Iron Plus Initiative (NIPI) for anaemia control program, it would suffice if just one of the two food staple commodities – either salt or rice – is fortified,” Dr. Kurpad said, stressing on the need for a “precision-based approach”. However, gynaecologists in Karnataka said risk of excess overall iron intake is not an issue among women. Hema Divakar, Federation of Obstetric and Gynaecological Societies of India (FOGSI) ambassador to International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO), attributed this to low absorption levels mainly because of flouride contamination in water, rampant problem of chronic intestinal inflammation in women and the habit of drinking tea and chewing supari (beetel nut). Countering this, Dr. Anura Kurpad said, “We are talking about a habitual daily iron intake. When iron is given as a treatment, one balances the risks versus the benefit in severely anaemic women.”"

Over the next two days, more deaths were reported from four other areas, including from the neighbouring district of Jorhat, some about 40 km away from Halmira Tea Estate. By Saturday evening, the toll had climbed to 114. The victims include a mother-son duo, who are suspected to have supplied the local jaggery-based liquor, called ‘sulai’, at Halmira. The woman, Dhraupadi Urang (62), was among the first to report sick at the Halmira Tea Estate Hospital on Thursday evening, along with three other women — Angni Gowala (60), Bondhoin Bowri (54) and Belo Bhumij (62).

The liquor seized from Urang’s house will be sent for forensic analysis. According to relatives of victims in Halmira, the ‘sulai’ sellers in the village used to procure the liquor from Jogibari, a neighbouring village which reported at least two deaths. In Jogibari, villagers said at least four families are engaged in making and selling ‘sulai’. All these families are absconding since Saturday morning. “Just because they (the families in Jogibari) were making the liquor does not mean that the adulteration happened there. We have to find the source of adulteration. Our hunch is that methyl alcohol was the substance used, but that has to be chemically confirmed,” said SP Singh. “There can be multiple producers at different locations, we have to investigate what is the common contaminant,” he said. “People have been drinking this liquor for a long time now… This is the first time something like this has happened.

People are not aware that most food they are consuming might be adulterated or impure.From using unsafe synthetic food colours to compromising with food purity, health department’s food safety officers have found that all during their raids conducted in January and February.Even powdered spices are being sold in the market without packaging it. There are provisions under Food Safety Standard Act, which do not permit sale of spices without packaging. This year, food safety officers have taken their efforts to a new high to ensure availability of food safety but what they have found during their inspections could be just the tip of the iceberg.“We have found that food handlers at restaurants were not having any kind of medical fitness certificates. The certificate is necessary because if someone has tuberculosis and he is preparing or serving food, he may infect others. Also, if a food handler is suffering from any skin infection, he may transmit it to his clients. Under Food Safety and Standard Act (FSSA), there is a provision of fitness certificate, but we found that the restaurants are violating the norm of FSSA,” said a health department official.Besides, it has also been found during inspection that a restaurant selling Chinese food had kept vegetarian and non-vegetarian food at the same place, which is violation of FSSA. The health department had seized three such restaurants in past two months for violating FSSA norms. The three restaurants were re-opened only after renovation, as directed by the food safety wing.Also, the food safety officers claimed that among the total pulses samples, there four samples of pulses they had taken have failed quality test.

According to officials of the city Corporation’s health wing, the bacteria has been found in water supplied in plastic cans by private agencies. At present, there is no proper regulation of water supply in cans by these private agencies. With the detection of this case, the health wing is thinking of measures to have a mechanism to ensure the quality of drinking water supplied this way. “The issue here is that some of these restaurants do not have a proper water connection from the Kerala Water Authority. So, they depend on these private agencies to provide them drinking water in cans. This water is often used as it is for consumption and for cooking purposes. Water from where? We do not know where these agencies collect this water from or whether they take any measures to purify it. In this particular case, we have to look whether this agency is located within our limits or even outside the State. If it is within our limits, we can take measures to enforce certain standards with the help of the Food Safety Department,” said an official of the Corporation’s health wing. In January, more than hundred cases of food poisoning were reported from in and around Technopark. The city Corporation had conducted checks in food courts within the campus and outside, during which water samples were collected and stale food was seized. The coliform bacteria was detected in only one of the seven such samples collected. The Technopark authorities had also handed over a list of companies which are supplying water cans in the food courts and companies here. Usage of water from wells is also widespread in the area, although there is piped water supply. “During summer, there will be huge demand for these cans. So, we have to ensure that adequate standards are ensured by these companies which are involved in the business,” said the official."

The huge cache of liquor was to be smuggled to Loni from Haryana ahead of the Lok Sabha elections, police said.After receiving information about a truck carrying illegal liquor, the police setup a check post on Ram Vihar road on Sunday night.“Around 3.30 pm on Monday, we spotted the truck and chased it. Soon after, we seized the vehicle and arrested two men,” police said.Sanjay Verma, SHO of Loni police station told TOI that the arrested persons were identified as Bal Kishan (38) from Haryana and Amarchand (29) from Ghaziabad. “During questioning, they told us that some people had handed over the truck to them at the Haryana-Delhi border,” he added.An FIR was lodged against the two men under IPC sections 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 272 (adulteration of food or drink intended for sale) and 273 (sale of noxious food or drink), and sections 60, 63 and 72 of the Excise Act. “These people are part of a big gang, which has been smuggling in illicit liquor to UP from Haryana via Rajasthan,” the SHO said."
indiatimes.com,city,Panipuri is trending. But is it safe?,13-03-2019,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/panipuri-is-trending-but-is-it-safe/articleshow/68392312.cms,"Renu PS remembers cramming down pani puris when she was a student in Manipal. “It was commonly available there and I was having it for the first time,” says Renu, who used to work as a medical microbiologist. “As youngsters, we never bothered if it was healthy. All that mattered was that it was tasty and interesting,” she says.As a mother of three young children though, Renu’s attitude today to the pani puri stalls, which have mushroomed around Kochi, is quite different.“Now I am concerned about the oil, the fact that they don’t keep the ingredients covered and that they probably reuse leftovers,” she says.Adding to such concerns of consumers like her, in a recent incident at an outlet in Tripunithura which serves the popular north Indian street-side snack, a woman had vomited immediately after eating it. It prompted the food safety department to conduct raids in outlets in the area. Food safety officer Rani Chacko says that while they conducted a raid at the outlet over consumer complaints of stale pani puri being served, the officers did not find anything seriously wrong. “According to the discretion of the officers, if we feel it is a small issue, as a first step we give a rectification notice. The defects we have pointed out to them have to be tackled in a day before we give them the permission to operate again,” she says.The food safety department does not have a record of how many such ‘petty retailers’ operate or under what conditions and they take action only if an incident is brought to their notice.Around the city, at around 4 pm as pani puri sellers begin to set up their carts, they already have a clientele waiting. The vendors come with a large tray of mashed potato which is filled into bite-sized puris and topped with tangy and sweet watery gravy. It is a very hand-intensive operation; the puri is popped, filled and dipped into the water by the vendor.Die-hard pani puri fans, such as media entrepreneur Jayakrishnan G Pillai who treats his team to pani puri at the stalls, say customers are not here for healthy food. “I grew up in Mumbai and Gujarat, so I feel mentally prepared for a slight lack of hygiene. In Kerala, because we are not used to it, it feels problematic,” he says, adding he suffered food poisoning once from the food, but it did not put him off for long.Freelance dietician Fiza Nawaz, who did a thesis and documentary on the street food vendors of Kochi, says that she had drawn up a list of risk factors in street food in general and those specific to pani puri and chat stalls. On top of the list were that stalls were located near garbage dumps and the water for washing utensils was not from a tap but from buckets, which meant it was most likely being reused.“We sent some samples to the lab and found an alarmingly high count of microbes, particularly the staphylococcus aureus, which in high quantities bring on the symptoms of food poisoning,” she notes. She adds that though the food is handled a lot by hand, when the vendor fills the puri with potatoes and the sweet and tangy water, they are not aware of how to use gloves. “They don’t know that the gloves are only for handling the food. Instead, they make the pani puri with it and also handle other things, which destroys the purpose of using gloves,” she points out.Amit Sarkar , who runs an upscale eatery in Kochi, says that when he and his brother, Sourabh got into the business, one of the things they looked into keenly was hygiene because they are aware of how it is lacking in the stalls, and towards that end they are cautious about the oil, dough, water and the ingredients they use as fillings and storage. To up the ante, they have introduced an automatic pani puri machine, which allows the customers to fill their puris and cuts out the chances of contamination from a third person.“Almost 60% of vendors buy their puri from one supplier and when we bought from them, we found that it was not very clean and it was high in gluten content, so we started making our own,” says Amit, adding jokingly that his teenage niece prefers the roadside pani puris which are handmade by vendors.Munna Yadav , who started his pani puri outlet over two decades ago, says the food is freshly made and leftovers are thrown away. The puris are fried at about 10 am while the other ingredients are made just before the stall is set up at 3 pm. He sells a plate of six at `20 and gets through 800 puris in a day.Rani Chacko says that though there are no written guidelines for street food vendors, the department is planning a ‘street food hub’ programme, which is in the initial stage, and seeks to identify street food vendors, audit and designate and identify their areas of working. Awareness programmes will also be conducted for them."

The main advisory is to keep the body hydrated with adequate intake of water at regular intervals. While the minimum temperature remained 24 degree Celsius, the maximum temperature varied between 35 and 37 degree Celsius in the city in the last few days. Director of Public Health K. Kolandasamy said no cases of sun stroke were reported in the State. “With the rise in temperature, the body will easily get dehydrated. There should be enough intake of water to avoid chances of getting the body dehydrated. Natural drinks like buttermilk and tender coconut water are other alternatives to keep body hydrated,” said Dr. Kolandasamy. He said that the department has brought out an awareness pamphlet on precautions to be taken in the summer. As per the Health Department advisory, special attention should be given to newborns, children, pregnant women and the elderly in the summer. People having multiple diseases should also take precautions. Excessive thirst, headache, fatigue, giddiness, sprain in muscles, low urine output and seizures could be symptoms of over dehydration, which will lead to other complications. Cotton dress The advisory asks public to keep water with them while going out in the summer. The public are advised to wear cotton dresses which give adequate ventilation. There should also be adequate ventilation in houses for free movement of fresh air. B. Vijayalalithambigai, Designated Officer of FSSAI, Coimbatore, said that the department has advised shopkeepers and vendors to keep the premises clean to avoid chances of contamination in the summer. Vendors have been advised to use fresh fruits, milk and water to prepare cool drinks and juices. “While consuming beverages from outside, the public should make sure that such products are stored in hygienic conditions in closed containers. Consumers must check whether the product is certified by FASSAI in the case of packaged products. One should also check the manufacturing and expiry dates,” she said."

But, in most cases, hygiene is given a go by. Customers have no way of knowing if the ice cubes are sourced from manufacturing units functioning in hygienic conditions. The handling of the broken ice by the sellers is another grey area. “Contamination of ice used in shops cannot be ruled out,” said Designated Officer for Food Safety Chitra. “A number of temporary shops have sprung up and department officials will fan out to conduct checks on the quality of ice used for making cool drinks.” Ice is made with fresh water. But it becomes contaminated due to use of unclean water as well as unhealthy handling practices, according to nutritionists. There is a misconception that freezing water kills bacteria or viruses. That is not the case. The Food Safety department is prepared to take action on public complaints of incidences of illnesses caused by unhealthy handling of ice, Dr. Chitra said. Leave alone handling of ice cubes by sellers, suppliers drag the ice slabs before breaking them and filling the crushed pieces in thermocol boxes. Last year, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) issued guidelines for differentiation between edible ice made with potable water and non-edible ice made with non-potable water. In order to prevent misuse of non-edible ice as edible ice, FSSAI issued directions to Food Safety Commissioners of all States that food colour (indigo carmine or brilliant blue up to 10 ppm) must be used in production of non-edible ice."

Mayor Thottathil Raveendran told the council that the multicrore project, which was included in the Kozhikode master plan, was envisaged to solve the transportation problems in the city. The KMRL would submit a preliminary report as well as a Detailed Project Report on the project. As of now, the civic body would not have any financial commitment. The Centre would contribute 40% of the total cost of the bus port project. Each State would be allotted a project, he said. The project, Mr. Raveendran said, would come up on a 20-acre land and it would be implemented under the public-private partnership (PPP) model. The civic body was unable to bear the huge expenditure for the project. Besides, land had to be acquired for the purpose. He said the Regional Town Planner had held several rounds of meetings with landowners and almost all of them had agreed to hand over land for the project. However, Opposition leader in the council P.M. Suresh Babu and Indian Union Muslim League member C. Abdurehiman raised doubts about the project. The council members had not been apprised of the project until such an idea was placed before the meeting, they said.

The seizure of various raw materials used in manufacturing of guthka estimated at ₹30 lakh has put the spotlight on Guntur, which was once a hub of illegal guthka trade. Following a series of raids on those units, many of them have shut down and some have moved to other towns. Consumption of guthka is banned in India under the Food Safety and Standards (Prohibition and Restriction on Sales) Regulations of 2011 and the Food Safety and Standards Act of 2006. In 2015, Andhra Pradesh joined 17 other States to ban guthka and other tobacco products. According to Regional Vigilance and Enforcement Officer V. Sobha Manjari, teams of vigilance wing, with the help of the local police, raided a dilapidated house on Etukuru Road on credible information that guthka was being manufactured there. The sleuths found many bags of betel nut, tobacco powder, and other essence, which are used in making of gutkha. The police also found many pulverising machines and packing units in the house. The police said that the unit was being run by a suspended police constable from Telangana, Palem Rammohan Rao, and his son, Palem Chandrasekhara Rao, and his brother Siva Kumar. While Chandrasekhara Rao has been arrested, the other two are absconding. Cases filed The accused reportedly admitted to have started the business two months ago. Cases have been filed under Sections 188, 272, 273, 420 IPC, Section 56, 57 and 63 of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006. After making the gutkha, the unit owners pack them into tiny sachets priced at ₹10 and ₹15 and sell them under various brand names. The police seized Khaleja Gutkha (10 bags), MC Gutkha (12 bags), Blue Bull Tobacco (58 bags) and Super Star Gutkha (½ bag). “This is the single biggest seizure of gutkha in the State, and the Vigilance unit here has been keeping an eye on all such illegal manufacturing units. The accused may have chosen Guntur since it is centrally located and hence it is easy to ship the contraband to other parts of the country,” said Ms. Sobha Manjari."

Acting on the orders of Food Safety Commissioner (in-charge) Beela Rajesh and Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao and instructions of District Designated Officer Thanga Vignesh, a team of food safety officials (FSOs) from different regions raided the godowns and made the seizure. The FSO team comprising M. Dharmar (Ramanathapuram), S. Muthusamy (Paramakudi), A. Karnan (Thondi), P. Veeramuthu (Nainarkoil) and M. Saravanakumar (Kadaladi) conducted the raids to create awareness among consumers and deter fruitsellers who stocked and sold chemically ripened mangoes. The officials checked five godowns and seized 1.5 tonnes of the fruit, ripened either by spraying liquid ethipon chemical or calcium carbide stones. The seized mangoes, unfit for human consumption, would be destroyed. On learning about the raids, some of the fruit merchants closed the godowns and fled. Officials said the FSOs would continue to conduct surprise raids throughout the district and warned fruit merchants against stocking and sale of chemically ripened mangoes, which posed serious health hazard. The merchants procured and stocked the mangos in the pre ripening stage and used the chemicals for quick ripening. Such mangoes would be uniformly yellow and would not submerge in a bucket of water. The naturally ripened ones would have uneven green and yellow shades and submerge in water, they added."

According to police sources, the raid was conducted late on Wednesday night based on a tip-off received by Police Inspector Daya Nayak, Khar police station. The information indicated that a large quantity of chloral hydrate was being stored in a godown in Aarey Colony in Goregaon. A joint team led by Senior Police Inspector Vijaylaxmi Hiremath, Aarey police station and Mr. Nayak raided the godown at 11 p.m. on Wednesday. Raid after arrest “We seized 78 sacks, filled with 2,184 kg of chloral hydrate stored in the godown and arrested the owner, identified as Buniyad Ahmed Ansari (51). During his interrogation, he revealed that the chemical was stored in the godown by one Venkaya Karbuja (48). We raided his residence in the Unit 31 in Aarey Colony and found a further quantity of 56 kg chloral hydrate, along with 45 kg socium saccharin and citric acid, and 35 litres of toddy,” Ms. Hiremath said. Mr. Karbuja, along with his accomplice Rajendra Bhusrupu, were subsequently arrested and all three accused were charged with causing hurt by means of poison, adulteration of food or drink intended for sale and sale of noxious food or drink under the Indian Penal Code along with relevant sections of the Maharashtra Prohibition Act. An officer who is part of the investigation said the three accused were making synthetic toddy instead of brewing the drink naturally, and the chloral hydrate, which is available in solid form and is used for treating insomnia as well as narcotics withdrawal, acts as the intoxicant. “Mr. Karbuja has confessed that this is the third time he has brewed toddy using the chemical, which means hundreds of authorised toddy centres in the city are selling the unhealthy, spurious toddy. There can be near-fatal effects on the body if the quantity of chloral hydrate in the toddy goes above a certain limit,” the officer said. Investigations till now have also revealed that the chloral hydrate was sourced from a supplier in Gujarat, and the police are trying to trace him. Known to be addictive, chloral hydrate combined with other forms of alcohol, forms a strong sleep-inducing drink that is in great demand as an illegal narcotic abroad. The combination is known as ‘Mickey Finn’ in the West, named after a saloon manager accused of robbing his customers after knocking them out with chloral hydrate drops in their drinks."

We have supplied aprons and gloves to bitchers, but most of them refused to use them,” said Barbuddhe.It was found during the investigation that none of them had previously taken tests for zoonotic diseases. “As per FSSAI rules, the company or government agency that engages them must conduct regular medical check-up, but that’s not happening. Slaughter houses are also not doing it,” said Barbuddhe. Researchers also found skin infections in those handling sheep. “While slaughtering the animal, if it touches the ground, the meat gets contaminated. In most shops selling meat, they don’t clean the floor properly. Food-borne disease is likely in case a buyer consumes such meat. Storage is another important issue. With their dirty clothes, the butchers go home due to which their children and other family members get affected,” said Barbuddhe.The study also found that butchers injure their hands and fingers, including amputation, but these are not attended to properly.GHMC fined many meat-selling shops in the city. GHMC chief veterinary officer Dr Venkateswara Reddy said of the 3,354 meat shops in the city, 1,518 were prosecuted and around Rs 1.43 lakh collected as fine. “We seized 2,708 kilograms of mutton and 10,218 kg beef and prosecuted them in court for not maintaining hygiene in shops,” said Reddy.In Hyderabad, NRCM conducted two awareness camps for butchers and the next one will be held on May 15."

According to an administration release, use of newspapers, recycled paper and plastic sheets by eateries, tea stalls to wrap hot food can result in food contamination causing health hazard. The new guidelines on food packaging under the Food Safety and Standards (Packaging and Labelling) Regulations, 2011, will come into force in July 2019. The guidelines take into account the carcinogenic effect of newsprint ink and dyes and bring into force new norms on packaging prohibiting use of newspapers, recycled paper, cardboards, plastic covers among others. The new FSSAI guidelines, based on studies has found heavy metal and chemical contamination in food items based on the packaging materials used. This largely applied to the unorganised sector such as small eateries, tea stalls etc where piping hot food is served in newspapers, plastic sheets, recycled sheets among others. Fried hot food items are squeezed to drain out oil using newspapers. Such food is contaminated by the newsprint ink. Earlier, a study was conducted by FSSAI in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Packaging, Mumbai and the National Test House, Kolkata. The test concluded that the food samples collected from the unorganised sector was contaminated by the packaging materials used. In its wake, the FSSAI has amended the existing provisions with respect to packaging. All food businesses shall comply with the new norms, it said."

Excise sleuths here have initiated the proceedings for cancellation of licences of 16 toddy parlours functioning in the Vaikom, Kaduthuruthy and Kanjirappally regions after a recent analysis of toddy samples collected from the outlets tested positive for cannabinoid — a ganja-infused compound. “The licences of these shops have already been suspended and the parlour operators asked to appear for a hearing before the Excise Commissioner. This will be followed by cancellation of their licences and registration of cases for adulteration of toddy,” said Abdul Kalam, Divisional Deputy Excise Commissioner, Kottayam. According to the official, the presence of the adulterant agent in the drink was spotted during a routine sample analysis carried out at the Government Chemical Lab, Thiruvananthapuram. Based on the finding, a team led by the Excise Joint Commissioner (Intelligence) carried out a series of raids at toddy tapping centres in Palakkad and interrogated the parlour staff, besides collecting samples for a detailed analysis. “The results of the preliminary tests have been submitted for consideration of the court while another round of sample examination is in the pipeline,” the official added. Besides Kottayam, similar cases have been reported from Alappuzha and a few other shops in Pathanamthitta as well. Earlier raids The department had seized chloral hydrate-laced toddy from a few shops on earlier occasions though this was the first time they have come across such a compound in the drink. “The probe will prise open the toddy-adulterating networks that operate out of the two toddy consuming districts of Kottayam and Alappuzha,” said a senior excise official. These two districts, according to him, together account for over 1,000 toddy parlours — the most by any region in the State. He also attributed the latest bout of adulteration possibly to the emergence of a drug culture in the State. As per estimates, there are 583 toddy parlours operating in Kottayam and each outlet sells a daily average of 30 litres. The department has also issued 180 permits for trafficking toddy from the tapping centres in Palakkad to Kottayam. The department has been sending a monthly average of 520 toddy samples for laboratory tests."

In summer, mangoes top the list of fruits that find entry into markets after treated chemically, largely for uniformed ripening, colour and shelf life. Papaya, some varieties of plantains, orange and pineapple are the other common fruits ripened artificially. “Food safety officers are inspecting fruit stalls and godowns to check the use of ripening agents in fruits in summer. More than a tonne of artificially ripened mangoes and more than two tonnes of rotten fruits were seized and destroyed as they were unfit for consumption. The checks will continue in the coming days too,” said B. Vijayalalithambigai, Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) designated officer in Coimbatore. It is also a tough task for the FSSAI team to have regular inspections at the 600-odd fruit stalls and godown in the district. Ukkadam, Gandhipuram, Sulur, Mettupalayam and Pollachi are the main markets where fruits arrive for distribution to retailers. Calcium carbide stone and ethylene powder are widely used by traders to ripen the fruits artificially in Coimbatore. “Last year, we had more incidents of using calcium carbide. This year, we seized fruits ripened using ethylene powder in crude methods while use of calcium carbide was not found. We conducted awareness sessions for traders and those harvesting mangoes on proper use of ripening agents which are not harmful to humans,” she said. Crude methods of using ethylene powder wherein it comes in direct contact with the fruit is not permissible, the same agent in gas form in limited levels is allowed for use in specially designed fruit ripening chambers. Sources with fruits traders said that they were lacking such chambers in the district forcing them to go for cheaper ripening methods. According to city-based gastroenterologist V.G. Mohan Prasad, calcium carbide has traces of arsenic and phosphorus which are toxic to human body. “These toxic contents can trigger nausea, infection in throat, diarrhoea and burning sensation in stomach. Chronic consumption of fruits ripened using agents like calcium carbide can even cause cancer. Though the use of chemicals for ripening fruits is banned in several countries, it is unfortunately available in India,” he added. Cheap rate and fast result are also factors that force traders to use calcium carbide as ripening agent. C. Eswari, a home maker from city, said that it was not easy to identify artificially ripened fruits from the stocks displayed at shops and supermarkets. According to Ms. Vijayalalithambigai, it is always better to follow some check-list to avoid buying and consuming artificially ripened fruits."

The sleeve should contain, among other things, the name of the company, address, packing date, expiry date, FSSAI and BIS licence numbers,” said A. Ramakrishnan, designated officer, Tamil Nadu Food Safety and Drug Administration Department. “Along with the sleeve, consumers should see if the water is transparent, odourless, colourless and crystal clear. This is only to ensure that consumers get quality water that does not harm them in any way. Water contamination could be a serious issue if the water is not treated or packaged properly. We are asking manufacturers to ensure that sleeves are printed and pasted with correct details. We have also directed them to provide details of companies that fill bubble tops at their facilities so that they too could be brought into the loop,” Mr. Ramakrishnan said. Vehicle checks The department, which began its checks on packaged drinking water manufacturers last month, has now begun checking vehicles transporting water. “There are many companies from neighbouring Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram that supply drinking water to the city, which is why we want those companies to comply with the norms. In the meantime, the department is insisting that transporters too take licences, since it is mandatory under the Food Safety Act,” he said. The department will continue checking vehicles bringing bubble tops and water bottles to ensure that everyone, including the manufacturers, transporters and suppliers become part of the chain. Even those supplying drinking water to houses must obtain licences, an official explained. Mangoes destroyed Meanwhile, the department has also been seizing mangoes ripened using ethylene powder directly near the fruit. Artificial ripening is allowed if the raw mangoes are treated with ethylene gas in chambers. There is a standard operating procedure. Officials have met individual shopkeepers, demonstrated the correct procedure and also kept banners at the Koyambedu market. But some shops still do not follow these. Therefore, over 4.5 tonnes of fruits, worth ₹3.5 lakh, were seized. “Cases are being filed against three mango vendors for not following the standard operating procedure,” said an official."

Speaking to The Hindu , A. Jagannathan, city health officer said it was difficult to entirely rule out water contamination. “People out of the goodness of their heart distribute juices, water and buttermilk. But, the source of the water they use might be questionable. Health inspectors have been trying to keep a check on them. We had to request people to source water from the corporation tanks, especially during temple festivals,” he said. Meanwhile, the corporation has been taking steps to treat water at the source itself, said Mr. Jagannathan. “Conventionally most civic bodies treat water with bleach before supplying. We pump liquid chlorine at the collection tanks itself,” he said. The team of engineers keep close tabs on breaches, such as water pipe leakage, contamination and follow it up quickly, he added Chlorine, according to Mr. Jagannathan is the best and easiest water purifier. “We use liquid chlorine and pump it into the tanks which ensures that the entire tank is disinfected,” he said. The corporation also hands out chlorine tablets to residents. Residents say that in addition to the chlorination of drinking water by the civic body, a second-level purification was necessary. “At our house, just like most other houses on our street, we prefer packaged drinking water cans. The cans come at an affordable rate and are of good quality. We do not need to invest in a water purifier which costs thousands of rupees,” said S. Muthu, a resident in Thillai Nagar. The quality of the packaged drinking water, however, may vary, say officials. To keep a check, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) provides details on most of the licensed manufacturing units across the State on www.safewater.fssai.gov.in . Consumers can check the quality of the packaged drinking water supplied to them by entering the license number or BIS number printed on the package. Details, including lab reports, about when the unit was started and various parameters tested for water quality."

A team led by S.D. Balakrishnan, Designated Officer of the Food Safety Department who participated in the early morning raids on 20 shops, said that six shops had stocked artificially ripened mangoes and bananas. The fruits were seized and would be destroyed at a site near the Food and Drug Testing lab in Gorimedu. The team seized an ethylene sachet used to ripen the fruits. The sachet was placed in a basket containing mangoes. According to Mr. Balakrishnan, ethylene sachets were now used to ripen the fruits quickly. Only permissible level of ethylene gases in special ripening chambers was allowed by the government. The indiscriminate use of ethylene and carbide for artificial ripening of fruits could cause health problems. Short shelf-life The fruits had a shorter shelf-life and were inferior in taste and flavour. Artificially ripened mangoes could be easily identified through a careful examination of the fruit. The fruits, when cut open, would be less juicy than the naturally ripened ones. On the other hand, naturally ripened fruits would have good aroma and natural colour. The team found traces of carbide powder on the fruits and samples were taken from 13 shops located on Rangapillai Street and Bharathi Street. The samples would be tested at the Food and Drug Testing lab in Gorimedu. Notices would be sent to the shops which had used artificial ripening agents, he said."

indiatimes.com,city,Fruits still chemically ripened in Kerala,01-06-2019,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/fruits-still-chemically-ripened-in-kerala/articleshow/69610561.cms,"Mango were among the few things to relish in our exhaustingly hot summer months. But times are such that consumers have to think twice before laying hands on the fruit. Buying mangoes had become risky with reports over the past few years of traders using toxic carbide stones to ripen the fruit quickly. So, do local authorities take pre-emptive monitoring measures to ensure the safety of consuming this before the season? The bad news is that inspections by the Food Safety Department in the various districts have found that mangoes are not the only fruits being matured using chemicals.Carbide reacts with the moisture emanating from mangoes to release acetylene gas causing stomach upsets, vomiting and diarrhoea.Long term consumption can cause oxygen levels to reduce in the body leading to fatigue, headaches, memory loss and convulsion, says the Kollam district DMO Dr R Sandhya . She adds that they usually have encountered only patients who suffer from stomach problems after consuming the fruit. On long term use, if arsenic content is present in the calcium carbide, it can also prove to be carcinogenic.While the Kollam Corporation recently seized 400 tonnes of mango which had been ripened using carbide stones, the Food Safety Department in Ernakulam say they have not found any such instances this season. But that is not necessarily great news for the consumer; it is just a matter of not finding hard evidence. While the department says they have been vigilant since the start of the mango season with squad inspections, they admit that unless they find the physical evidence of carbide, it is almost impossible to say whether the substance has been used.“We get complaints, but don’t know how genuine they are,” says a food safety officer, who added that aanjili chakka (wild jack fruit), which had been artificially ripened was seized in Ernakulam and the vendor fined. “We received a circular from the head office in late-March to take samples of watermelon, chikku and banana. This year, there have not been many instances of carbide being detected in the district. There was a seizure by the food safety department in Iritty in Kannur and in Kollam, as far as we know,” says the officer. She also adds that the Aryankavu checkpost is monitored, as are the wholesale shops in Karunagappalli and Kollam, by the Food Safety and Health Departments. However, unless there is physical evidence of carbide, there are no authentic tests to detect it in the fruit.Also, she admits that there is no way to find if carbide has been used in the fruit coming from neighbouring wholesale markets. And while ethylene, another substance used to ripen fruit, is permitted, there is no monitoring to check if it is done by wholesalers and trades in permissible amounts, beyond which this too poses health risks.But perhaps most shockingly for Kerala, even the coconut isn’t spared. Consumers get a raw deal when they buy what they think is a mature coconut, but is actually one that has been smoked with sulphur gas.The Food Safety Department in Kollam recently made seizures in Thattamala (one tonne), Kottarakara and Chavara. “This is a new trend and it is done to make a quick buck on not matured coconuts, on which they would not get a good price. But the consumer will find that it is spoilt when they open it up if the raw coconut itself wasn’t good,” says food safety officer Dr Agatha M, adding that if the product has not been spoilt, the vendors are fined and made to use the coconuts as copra.Traditionally, sulphur was used on copra to prevent fungal infection, but apparently it does not leave a residue, according to Agatha. “But this might not been the same with coconut,” she says, adding that since this is a new phenomenon, no studies on its effects have been done, though the fumes are toxic for kids.For someone who is ill, fruits are the healthiest thing to consume, but it ends up having the opposite effect when it is toxically ripened, notes Dr Sandhya. The fruits need to be thoroughly washed and peeled before eating. Also, the buyers should check whether there are any cuts on the skin while buying the fruit, so that the chemical would not have seeped in."

In the Keerapakkam stone quarry, a 22-year old murdered body of a man found four months ago.Now, private tankers are pumping water from the same quarry and supplying to households. Even from a quarry near Thiruporur, a body was fished out in January and tankers pump water from there too.As per rules, the legal responsibility to check the quality of water lies with Metrowater and they act only if there are complaints. The local bodies and food safety department, under the Public Health Act, support Metrowater by checking water contamination regularly. In March, Greater Chennai Corporation had picked up 621 samples and found 36 unfit for consumption.“The problem is that they check for quality only when we complain,” said S Gopi, secretary of Subramania Nagar Civic and Welfare Association in Kodambakkam. He added, “We are worried about the quality and don’t use tanker supply for drinking or cooking purposes. We use this only for washing and bathing. Also, the situation is so bad that we somehow adjust as we don’t want to irk the private water supply companies.” Metrowater and public works departments formed a committee in October 2018 to regulate private water tankers.“A draft report has been submitted to the chief secretary and we await corrections after which it will be passed in the assembly. These norms will ensure water is drawn only from permitted locations, treated before supply, rules for the permit and other details. A team would be formed to monitor the implementation,” said a senior metro water official.Gopalakrishnan V, a civic activist, said, “Many gated communities treat the water in their RO plants before use. And other residents have no choice but to boil before use. Also, tanker owners won’t tell us where they pumped the water from and say they cannot give any certification on the quality of water,” he said.The officials at the public works department, under whom the lakes and quarries come, were unavailable for comments. Some quarries also belong to industries and revenue department. Concerns arise over quality of tanker water ."

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami will present the special award to Ms. Shilpa at the Secretariat on June 13. Along with Ms. Shilpa, Commissioner of Food Safety and Drug Administration P. Amudha, Principal Secretary, Department of Information Technology Santhosh Babu and Commissioner for Disaster Management Rajendra Ratnoo have also been selected for this award for taking special efforts to enforce ban on the use-and-throw plastic products under their jurisdiction. When she visited Courtallam in the second week of June last after assuming office on May 25, Ms. Shilpa, on seeing the liberal use of plastic products by the tourists and the traders in the ‘Spa of the South’, raided good number of shops immediately to seize the banned plastic products. The Courtallam town panchayat officials, who were accompanying the Collector during her inspection, had tough time then. As Ms. Shilpa started visiting Courtallam repeatedly during ‘Season 2018’, the officials were forced to act tough against the traders using or selling the banned plastic products. She also convened the meeting of the officials attached to the Department of Local Administration – right from village panchayat to the Corporation - and empowered them to seize the banned plastic products being manufactured, stored, sold and used in the areas under their jurisdiction, which yielded desirable results. Since they have to submit monthly reports to the Collector on the seizure of banned plastic products, raids are being conducted in a sustained manner. The Tirunelveli Corporation, on the Collector’s instruction, has even deployed special teams in all four zones for conducting raids everyday to seize the plastic products. So far, these special teams have seized over 4 tonnes of banned plastic products since January last."

When transporting these cans to an establishment or for door-to-door delivery, they should be covered and not exposed to the sun,” the official said.Adulteration of tea with colouring agents, which has been a major problem in both Nilgiris and Coimbatore, is banned, they said. “If establishments are found using adulterated tea, which is obviously less expensive, cases will be registered against the owners and the product will be seized.”"

The inspections focussing on harbours and fish markets will be continued till the end of trawling ban. “We have received complaints about marketing of frozen fish without any label mentioning the product details. This is an illegal practice and such stocks will be seized ” said Food Safety Assistant Commissioner P. Aleyamma. “However, we are yet to receive lab reports on the presence of formalin or any other adulterant in such products,” she said. Though Food Safety officials claimed that the checking was part of their routine activities, they made it clear that the squads would keep tabs on the purchase of formalin-laced fish from other States at a cheaper rates and its resale at local markets. They also said the public would be encouraged to pass on information about such attempts to the Food Safety squads. During the trawl ban last year loads of formalin-laced fish had been brought to the district from neighbouring States, cashing in on demand. The Food Safety squads blocked suspected vehicles on the district borders and sent them back after collecting the samples. Officials said there were several instances when the squad destroyed contaminated or formalin-laced stock after conducting inspections and imposed fine on the apprehended carriers. Those engaged in the sale of such stock in local markets were also traced to suppress the network, they said. Members of the Food Safety squad in the city said they carried out inspections at the Central Fish Market. In early morning operations, Food Safety officials inspected the fishing harbours at Beypore, Chaliyam and Chombal. An officer attached to the Food Safety office at Vadakara said the samples collected from Chombal were sent to the Regional Analytical Lab at Malaparamba. It was a frozen stock and the preliminary test result was negative showing no presence of formalin or ammonia, he said."

Raising the issue through a calling attention motion, Congress MLA Amit Deshmukh on Wednesday said that the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) found during a recent inspection in Mumbai that not only were most samples of lemon and sugarcane juices being sold in the open adulterated, but also was the ice mixed with it. “It was also observed that some farmers used chemical sewage released from factories in the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) area in Dombivli to grow vegetables along the railway lines,” Mr. Deshmukh said. Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Ajit Pawar said the State government had earlier recommended to the Centre that those adulterating milk be punished with life imprisonment. “Similarly, a life sentence should be awarded to those selling adulterated food and juices. On behalf of the Opposition, I assure total cooperation in bringing in such a provision,” he said. State Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Minister Jaykumar Rawal said that in such cases, the licensing authority is the local civic body, but the FDA takes action whenever incidents of food adulteration were brought to its notice. “Action on about 8,012 hawkers was taken from April to May. As many as 21,463 kg of food items, 36,054 litres of juice and 1,16,823 kg of ice were seized following inspections in Mumbai,” Mr. Rawal said. Ramdev for strict action Yoga guru Baba Ramdev, too, on Wednesday called for stricter punishment for those indulging in food adulteration, an offence which at present only has a provision for a six-month jail term. The Yoga guru, who called for a life term for food adulterators, was speaking to reporters at Mantralaya. He will be participating in the International Yoga Day function in Nanded with Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Friday. Ramdev said yoga should not be politicised and should work as medicine for world health, peace, harmony and unity. He also appealed to all political parties to perform yoga to boost confidence. “Yoga is a scientific, spiritual and universal lifestyle. It is very easy. Those who say they do not have time to do yoga can also practice it and make their mind peaceful. The whole world does yoga, which has given prestige to India across the globe,” he said. Ramdev noted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is the first prime minister of the country to perform yoga in public. “His ministers, MPs and MLAs do yoga in the public domain. Some of them do it with the whole heart, some without any interest. But all of them do it since their chief does it. Thus, yoga has been given prestige,” he said."

Mycotoxins are chemical toxins produced by various species of fungi which contaminate a variety of food commodities, particularly cereals, oilseeds, and spices. They are considered food safety hazards in view of their impact on human and animal health, said NIN Director N. Hemalatha on Wednesday. Addressing the inaugural of ‘International Partnership Workshop’ organised by NIN and Aberdeen University on dietary mycotoxin exposure in India and possible link to chronic diseases, she said the joint research team would soon take up work on the theme. Ms. Hemalatha said for NIN, food safety was an important part of ensuring nutrition security and thus has initiated several studies since the late 60s. Research outcomes from these have helped many regulatory bodies like the FSSAI and BIS set standards and safety limits for food. Similarly, the latest research would help in many such efforts, she added. Food safety expert Ramesh V. Bhat, in his keynote address, pointed out that fungi contamination of important food commodities such as cereals, millets, groundnuts and spices has been documented, but most studies have looked into short-term health impacts, including those on cattle, poultry and humans. The current workshop would explore long-term health effects and chronic diseases, he added. “Studies, especially in Africa, indicate the possible links of mycotoxins exposure in diet to growth impairment in young children. In India, mycotoxins assume a significant public health problem as highlighted by various incidents of acute mycotoxin poisoning,” said Silvia Gratz of University of Aberdeen. The TS government would certainly take into cognisance the scientific inputs to strengthen its civil supplies, said Commissioner of Food and Civil Supplies Akun Sabharwal."

(Video grab) Overthrowing the well celebrated Kuluki Sarbath, a new fizzy drink has captured the attention of Kerala this summer. Fuljar Soda, or Ful-jar? No one knows the exact name or what it actually means, but the cool new drink seems to have originated in the northern Malabar region of the state as temperatures soared to new highs this year. Making its grand entry to the Iftar parties, the not-just-a-boring-soda has captured the hearts of “Mallus”, more for the theatre that comes with it than the taste of the drink itself. The theatre is the fact that the drink is served in two glasses, the large tumbler contains chilled soda which has lemon and sugar syrup and the other shot glass contains a concoction of neem, ginger paste and mint leaves, creating a myriad of flavour experience for its customers. The drink comes into action when the shot glass is dropped into the glass tumbler, making the soda erupt like a volcano. It is gulped down, bottoms up as it froths. “Although it’s difficult to gulp it all down in one go, in order to get the “authentic” Fuljar experience, the drink should be gulped and not sipped,” says Nayana, a college student who was recently introduced to the Fuljar madness. Story continues below this ad The method of having the drink has caught more attention than the beverage itself. Due to its popularity, various other regional variations like orange, grape, strawberry, pineapple and watermelon are also in demand. “The spicy-tangy taste of the drink is a big hit among customers, especially in the scorching heat,” adds Nayana. “Because of the heat, people are willing to try anything which is cool and fizzy, but of course Fuljar has the thrill of the spill.” From YouTube to Tik-Tok, the frothy fad has found itself a place across social media, flooding it with pictures and videos of youngsters gulping down the summer drink. Though the drink is yet to reach all corners of the state, the trick is being gradually learned in almost all cool bar kiosks. But then monsoon is going to play spoilsport. “The demand is high, but it is soon going to die down, just like any other trend in Kerala,” says Hainz Martin, owner of a makeshift roadside cool bar in Palarivattom, Kochi. “Sales have already started dropping as the Nipah scare resurfaced. Monsoon will be a huge factor too,” he adds. In addition to this, various medical practitioners have come up to warn of the bad effects of the drink. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQWI7Jl9qyc Story continues below this ad Recently, the tangy beverage was under the radar of the Food Safety Department too after complaints regarding the quality of the drink. It was when various photographs and videos of unhygienic Fuljar drinks surfaced on social media that the officials seized various products used in making the beverage, in and around Kozhikode. However, all this does not seem to deter young food buffs and Instagrammers. The trendy beverage, which has gathered popularity in Kochi and Kannur, is now finding favour across the state and slowly spilling over to other locations too. Martin, who personally prefers Kulukki Sarbath says that Fuljar is all about its theatrics and is convinced people will soon come back to Kuluki."

Nanded superintendent of police Sanjay Jadhav told TOI that the action was taken based on a specific input. “We are confident of unearthing the entire racket that appears to be spread across India,” he said.According to police, the two heavy vehicles, including a container, reached Nanded in the wee hours of Monday.Gutka has been banned in the state for the past five years.Jadhav has appealed to the people to come forward with whatever specific information they have about illegal activities and assured them of keeping their identities a secret.The first vehicle was stopped on the Necklace road situated on Nanded-Hyderabad highway. It was carrying gutka worth Rs17 lakh. The second vehicle was identified as a container carrying the banned substance worth Rs91 lakh. Police have also seized both the heavy vehicles and the process of summoning the transporters is underway.Based on the seizures, Nanded police have registered two offences under sections 328 (using poisonous substance for causing hurt), 272 (adulteration of food or drink intended for sale), 273 (sale of noxious food or drink) of the IPC based on the complaint lodged by food safety officer Umesh Kawde.In addition to this, the suspects have also been slapped with the relevant sections of Food and Safety Act 2006. Preliminary probe has revealed that the container had started from New Delhi on June 19 for delivering gutka at a Nanded-based transporter’s godown, while the other vehicle is suspected to have come from Andhra Pradesh Jadhav said, “Those into gutka trade are found shielding the banned stuff under regular luggage and goods that get transported in trucks.”An FDA official said it is almost impossible to stop and check every truck entering the district and taking advantage of the same, the suspects bring in gutka from other states.“Nanded district shares its border with states of Telangana and Karnataka and is often used by the gutka traders to get their goods into Maharashtra,” the official said."

With trawling ban in force, large quantities of fish are being brought from other States to the district. Madhusoodanan B., Assistant Commissioner of Food Safety, Alappuzha said here on Monday that around 1,800 kg of rotten fish had been seized from different parts of the district in raids in the last one month. “The department has intensified the raids after the trawling ban came into force. We have seized 1,500 kg of stale fish from Kayamkulam alone. Raids will continue in the coming days,” Mr. Madhusoodanan said. No chemical-laced fish The assistant commissioner, however, said no chemical-laced fish had been seized in the raids in the district since the start of the trawling ban. “We are conducting thorough and regular checks to ensure that neither rotten nor chemical-laced fish is sold in the district,” he added. The department is using rapid detection strip tests to find the presence of formalin and other chemicals in fish. Food Safety officials, as part of Operation Sagar Rani, conducted inspections in fish markets and vehicles transporting fish at Nedumudi, Mankombu, Purakkad, Punnapra, Nangiarkulangara and Thalavadi on Sunday, seized 60 kg of stale fish and destroyed it. Formalin-laced The Food Safety Department has launched Operation Sagar Rani across the State after it noticed that fish being brought to the State contained toxic chemicals such as formalin. Officials said that ammonia and formaldehyde were commonly used to increase the shelf life of fish brought from other States."

With the fish vendors putting up a stiff resistance to the raid, the officials had to seek the help of the police to complete the proceedings. Tuna and Seer fish The officials seized stale fish of tuna (Choora) and seerfish (Neymeen) varieties from six vendors. Most of it were at least four to five days old. Worms were found in some of the seized fish. The vendors claimed that the stale fish were not for sale but were kept to be dried. Claim refuted This claim was refuted by the officials who also seized a batch of stale fish that was cut and kept aside to be taken to a restaurant and a toddy shop. The fish vendors put up resistance to the raid, accusing the officials of taking away even the fresh fish. “We had requested the presence of Food Safety and Fisheries department officials because they have the expertise to detect stale fish using special strips and other mechanisms. This would be convincing for the fish vendors too. Still, there was resistance from the fish vendors as the raid progressed. We have not conducted raids in the Connemara fish market for a long time, mainly due to the chance of resistance. Now, we will conduct frequent checks to ensure that fresh fish is sold. It has to be said that there were some vendors who were selling only fresh fish,” said Palayam circle Health Inspector G. Manoj, who led the raid. According to Health wing officials, the raids were conducted following complaints the Corporation was getting in recent weeks. Last week, a person registered a complaint at the Corporation office, saying that his children had been affected with food poisoning after consuming fish bought from the market. Complaint Another complaint regarding quality of fish was received by the food safety authority, citing the exact locations of the vendors selling stale fish. Following the raid by the authorities, the officials removed the stale fish, while some of the samples were sent for testing to check for the presence of formalin. Further action, including imposing fine on the vendors responsible, would be taken based on the test result, the officials said."

The departments of Health and Food Safety do not have much of a say in ensuring hygiene in schools though two instances of shigella bacterial infection were reported in two weeks in different districts. Filthy water source Over 40 children of West Lower Primary School, Keezhppayyur, in Kozhikode district were hospitalised on June 21 after they complained of vomiting and diarrhoea. The presence of shigella bacteria in their stool samples and the subsequent testing of water samples proved that the water source used for cooking lunch had been contaminated. More than 90 children of the Government Lower Primary School, Eruva, near Kayamkulam in Alappuzha district, were taken ill with suspected food poisoning on July 5. The presence of shigella bacteria was found in the stool samples of at least two students there too. It is left to the education committee in local bodies to inspect the hygiene standards of the food preparation in schools in their jurisdiction ahead of the beginning of the academic year. Health Department officials, however, pointed out that the inspection and subsequent certification were often completed in a hurry as most of them would be preoccupied with other public health campaigns. The number of schools within the local body limits could be higher too. Most often, only random sampling of food and water was being done. In most of the schools, the kitchen and dining halls are found to be located in congested sheds. The areas for cleaning vessels and waste disposal too are in a similar condition. Though the government had mandated setting up biogas plants in schools, many schools were found to have purchased portable units just for the sake of it. The Food Safety Department, meanwhile, has the powers to declare only packaged food items as contaminated. MoU for testing samples Education Department officials, however, claimed that the State government in February last year had signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Cashew Export Council of India laboratory for the testing of food and water samples in schools. Food samples are subjected to microbiological and chemical testing. The lab had found the presence of E-coli bacteria, coliform bacteria and mold fungus in 14 of the 460 food samples collected from across 460 schools in different districts soon after the MoU was signed. It was reported that contamination occurred before serving the meal and through the water used for cooking it. The free lunch scheme is being implemented in 12,327 schools and the inspection had so far covered 8,000 schools. The rest would be covered soon, an official in charge of the scheme in the office of the Directorate of General Education told The Hindu on Wednesday."

For regular customers, the news came as a big surprise. Nineteen-year-old aviation student Athira J Moorthy said for the past 23 years, her father has been relying on the market for his catering business. “We depend on the market for everything, for vegetables and fish. When we learnt of the stale fish, it was upsetting. But I also think the garbage mound next to the market needs to be cleaned. The stench from the garbage is a big issue. Along with confiscating stale fish, they should also ensure that the market stays hygienic,” she said."

Less than 13% of the food adulterators in the state were convicted last year, despite an increase in complaints of food contamination from the public.Of the 2,384 cases filed over food safety issues in 2018-19, only 300 ended in conviction, shows official data.It also shows that conviction rate for such cases has always been low in the state, except for in 2017-18, when major reforms were introduced by the food safety department.Though Rs 5 crore was collected as fines from violators last year, consumer rights activists say the adulterators pay a paltry sum as fine individually.Activist K Kathirmathiyon said though there are stringent provisions in the Food Safety and Standards Act, adulterations will continue unabated if violators are not punished. “A case is filed only after samples are found adulterated/ misbranded in labs. After that, if an official is unable to get the adulterator convicted, the official should be pulled up and asked to explain why the case didn’t end with conviction,” he said.When contacted, Tamil Nadu food safety department officials said conviction rate depends largely on the number of samples collected and said they aren’t able to collect as many samples since more than 50% of technical posts are vacant.A senior official attributed the spike in conviction rate in 2017-2018 to major reforms introduced then. Until 2017, the Food Business Operators (FBOs), field-level officers who collect samples from food outlets, collected only one sample per block. It was increased to nine per block last year.The official, however, said the figures presented in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday were exaggerated since they are collecting as many samples as possible and a sudden decline in conviction rate was not possible. Data also suggests that many cases are still pending trial. While criminal cases (adulteration) are heard at the district and judicial magistrate (JM) courts, civil cases (misbranding/ mislabelling/ substandard quality) are inquired by the revenue department."

Stale food was seized from many eateries during the drive. Six squads comprising health inspectors and other Corporation employees inspected 59 restaurants in places such as Kamaleswaram, Manacaud, East Fort, Statue, Palayam, Thampanoor, and Karamana. The erring outlets have been instructed to rectify problems within seven days, failing which stringent steps will be initiated. Large quantities of used oil, stale and expired food products including chicken, beef, fish, eggs, cauliflowers, potatoes, tea powder, biryani, butter, rice, curd, mayonnaise, ice-cream, fruits, porotta and chapatti were confiscated from many eateries. Some restaurants were serving food that were nearly a week old. Dirty utensils While they initiated action against most restaurants for their failure to provide health cards for workers, the civic body also penalised the eateries for other violations including the use of dirty utensils, failure to segregate wastes, lack of store room, chimney and facilities for proper ventilation, and unclean water tanks and surroundings. A few outlets were also pulled up for their tardy upkeep of their interiors and instructed to paint the premises. The accumulation of leachate and food wastes that emanated foul odour within the restaurant compounds was also acted upon. Plastic bags seized Large quantities of banned plastic carry bags were also seized from several restaurants during the drive that was led by health supervisors Ajith Kumar, Prakash, and health inspectors Mohanachandran, Anoop Roy, Anil Kumar N.V. and Sujith Sudhakar. According to Mayor V.K. Prasanth, some restaurants had violated the norms on multiple occasions. The health wing has been directed to cancel the licences of such outlets. He added that all eateries, ranging from ‘thattukadas’ to five-star hotels, will be inspected during the days to come. The drive is as prelude to the launch of the civic body’s Subhojan project next month. As part of the project, workers of all eateries including hotels, restaurants, catering units, bakeries and wayside outlets in the city will be imparted training and issued identity cards."

However, many are doubtful. “The produce sold in Thiruvananthapuram came from Tamil Nadu, how come it is not adulterated when it reaches Kochi?” said Bindu, a resident of Kochi. An official with the Fisheries Department said this is because major markets are always under surveillance.“They know they are under the radar. We can assure the fish sold in city markets are free from chemicals. However, stale fish were seized from suburbs,” he added."

Joint raids will be held in various parts of the district before Onam and stringent action will be taken against those flouting rules. District Collector B. Abdul Nasar has instructed the food safety officials to ensure the quality of all beverages sold by roadside vendors, including full jar soda, an item that turned very popular recently. Since there has been complaints that unhygienic water and soda containing bleaching powder are being used for preparing the drink, inspections will be conducted in all outlets. Strips to detect formalin The district administration will also make available strips to check the presence of formalin, ammonia and other chemicals in fish. Recently the officials had seized huge volumes of formalin-laced pearl spot (karimeen) from some outlets in the city. Using the strip developed by Central Institute of Fisheries Technology (CIFT), customers can easily check the quality of the fish. Officials said finding chemical contamination using the white-coloured strips and the liquid that comes with it is easy. The strips should be scrubbed on the fish first and if the colour changes after the liquid is added, it shows the presence of chemicals. The strip, previously used by enforcement agencies during inspections, is currently available in market. Lab tests “As part of the drive, inspections will be held in hotels, fish markets, juice parlours, bakeries and ‘borma’ units. Samples will be collected from all places for lab tests and stringent action will be taken against those who violate food safety norms,” said the Collector speaking at the Food Advisory Committee meeting held in Kollam collectorate.

thehindu.com,cities,Food matters,22-07-2019,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/food-matters/article28629293.ece,"It was not long back when food safety raids in restaurants meant a one-off occurrence, which used to happen once or twice a year. In the past few months, however, the city Corporation has initiated numerous such raids that most of the restaurant owners are now on the guard, almost always. Officials of the health wing of the Corporation attest to the fact that the quantity of stale food seized from restaurants has been coming down progressively over the past few months, although the number of restaurants being raided has increased. Now the focus is on improving the facilities and the surroundings in which food is prepared. At least some of these restaurants have been negatively affected at getting their names included in the raided restaurants list, even though they did not have any stale food items stored. Yet, most of them are cooperating with the steps being taken by the local body now to ensure safe and clean food as they have been taken into confidence about the step ahead. All the frequent raids are leading up towards the launch of the city Corporation’s ambitious ‘Subhojanam’ project, which is meant to tackle the issue at its source, rather than leave it at the namesake raids. In discussions with experts from the field, the health wing of the civic body realised that they had to start from those handling the food, if they had to make a difference. Within six months of the launch of ‘Subhojanam’ in August this year, it will become mandatory for restaurants in the city to have trained food handlers in all its sections, be it cooking or supplying or packing. Health check-up All the existing workers in the industry will have to first undergo a health check-up, followed by which they will be provided ten to sixteen hours of training on how to handle food hygienically. “All those handling food items in restaurants will be provided training sessions on personal hygiene, proper handling of food items, waste management and segregation, and also basic inter-personal communication. In a rough survey conducted recently, we have found that around 50% of the workers in the industry are migrants. So, a working knowledge in Malayalam language will also be blended with the training module. Once they complete the training successfully, they will be given identity card for a trained food handler. It will be useful for them even if they leave the current job,” says Anoop Roy, a health wing official. The training process will begin from those working in wayside eateries, and will over its various phases cover all the restaurants. When a new worker joins a restaurant, they will have to be straight-away sent for the training session at the Corporation. The training programme will be anchored by the health wing staff mainly, with support from the Food Safety department, hotel management institutions, and the Literacy Mission. In recent raids, the health officials have found that only a handful of the workers in restaurants have the mandatory health cards. Now, there is a long queue at the Corporation office to get health cards. Waste segregation Waste management is one of the major issues that plague the sector. The city Corporation had recently introduced a by-law and facilitated waste collection from restaurants through nineteen firms, some of them located in the outskirts of the city, and some in Tamil Nadu. Much of the waste from restaurants has been unsegregated even now, with food waste mixed with plastic and other waste. As some of the firms who collect the food waste use it for feed in farms, unsegregated waste is useless for them. With Corporation officials giving strict instructions, some of the restaurants now have two separate bins for segregated collection of waste. As daily collection has begun, there is now no reason for the restaurants to store old food items, an excuse which they often use during raids. The Corporation has also begun following up strictly, after the initial raid and issuing of notices, to ensure that the changes that were demanded have been made. “Earlier, there was hardly any follow-up, and in many cases, they would be able to reopen their shops without making drastic changes. Now, they have realised that this is no longer the case as we have gone back and checked all of the raided shops to ensure that corrective steps have been taken. With ‘Subhojanam’ project, we will have a check-list of requirements for restaurants, which will be helpful during raids. The raids are not meant to trouble them or find fault with them, but to help make them aware and improve the quality of their food and services, which will, in the end, be beneficial to them, as it would attract more customers,” says S.S.

BHOPAL: Taking strong note of adulteration in milk and dairy products in the state, the Congress-led Kamal Nath government has decided to invoke stringent National Security Act (NSA) against those involved in the corrupt practice. State health minister Tulsiram Silawat said on Monday that instructions to invoke stringer laws have been issued to the officials to curb malpractice.""Synthetic milk and dairy products manufactured from the same are very much harmful to the health. The government will not spare anybody involved in the adulteration of food products. We have instructed to invoke NSA against those involved in such malpractice,"" health minister Silawat told reporters outside the assembly.Before announcing NSA, Silawat held a close door meeting with chief minister Kamal Nath to apprise him about recent raids conducted in Morena and Gwalior synthetic milk factories and seizure of large-scale adulterated dairy products. The chief minister is learnt to have given a go-ahead for strict action against the frauds. The minister also held subsequent meetings with the officials of state food and drug administration and health department and instructed to invoke NSA to curb adulteration.""We have noticed that milk and milk products including mawa, cheese and ghee are being produced using urea and deadly chemicals. To curb adulteration, the health department has decided to conduct raids through flying squads in all districts. Now we are invoking stringent laws to cease the malpractice,"" said Silawat.A day before, the health minister told the house that in 2018-19, 148 samples of food products were collected of which 29 failed on the test while cases were registered in 21 complaints. The department has also collected 2,291 samples from Indore and Ujjain of which 548 samples were failed and cases registered against 443 sellers.""During last two days, 255 samples of milk and dairy products have been collected from licensed shops and an eight-member team has been dispatched to collect samples from milk dairies in Morena, Gwalior andBhind . Some licenses have also been cancelled. NSA would be invoked after receiving the lab reports,"" he said.The minister further said that state government has instructed the divisional commissioners, district collectors and superintendents of police (SPs) to invoke NSA against all those involved in malpractice and adulteration of milk products. The government will take stringent action and officials who fail to comply with the instructions will have to face disciplinary action,"" he said.On last Thursday, the MP special task force (STF) busted three factories two in Chambal region that was supplying highly toxic synthetic milk to branded packed milk units in five states in connivance with quality control officers and agents. The police arrested 57 persons from Morena, Bhind districts and seized 20 tankers, 11 pickup vans and 2275 kg maltodextrin during the raids."

Directing Divisional Commissioners, District Collectors and Superintendents of Police to invoke the Act whenever necessary and the Food and Drug Administration Department to form flying squads to raid units manufacturing synthetic milk and dairy products, he said, “Adulterators will not be allowed to play with the health of people. Moreover, if officials adopt a callous attitude in catching them, they will face disciplinary action.” The State, for the first time, had invoked the Act in a case of milk adulteration against four persons in Gwalior two years ago. Stating that the adulterators were a threat to public health, State Controller of the Food and Drug Administration Department Ravindra Singh said, “After the rackets were discovered, we began collecting samples across the State and have sent them to a lab for testing. Mr. Silawat has asked us to identify and act against government officials who may be part of the nexus.” Spurious products in Morena and Bhind may still be on the market shelves, admits Mr. Singh. “We’re working on identifying the origin of the chain to break the supply,” he added. On July 19, on a tip-off, a Special Task Force team and the department raided Khandeshwari Dairy and Agrawal Chemicals in Amba in Morena district and found samples of the same shampoo, detergents and chemicals in both the places and milk laced with them. In Lahar in Bhind district, another team raided Naveen Traders and Gopal Chilling Centre where adulterated milk was seized."

On July 19, the State Food and Drug Administration Department and a Special Task Force raided units manufacturing synthetic milk and dairy products in Bhind and Morena districts. They seized 10,000 litres of synthetic milk, 500 kg of mawa and 200 kg of paneer from there and arrested around 60 persons, including conniving food inspectors. In response, the government cracked the whip on units manufacturing spurious milk across the State and State Public Health and Family Welfare Minister Tulsiram Silawat said the National Security Act (NSA), 1980, would be invoked against those involved in the illegal activity. It was unreasonable to go to the extent of invoking NSA against adulterators when there were so many cases remaining to be disposed of, said Mr. Dubey. “Those who’re stalling litigation and thereby not bringing the accused to the book must be held accountable for the proliferation of such rackets in the State. What’s the point of NSA, when the pendency rate is so high,” he asked. Forty-two cases in Bhind district relate to adulteration of milk and dairy products such as milk powder, mawa and paneer. Moreover, another 37 cases of adulteration are being investigated including one in which the Madhya Pradesh government is the accused party. The RTI reply says there were no registered cases of spurious drugs in the district. State Controller of the department Ravindra Singh admitted the high pendency rate was a concern. “We have apprised the Chief Secretary of the rate and plan to fastrack the process. We have also directed District Collectors to dispose of cases on a priority basis,” he said.

(Representational Image) Days after units producing synthetic milk were busted in Bhind and Morena districts of Madhya Pradesh, the state government has decided to legislate against food adulteration by treating it as a cognizable offence with a punishment of life imprisonment. Health and Family Welfare Minister Tulsiram Silawat said the Congress government will follow the Supreme Court directives and amend IPC Section 272 (adulteration of food or drink intended for sale) to introduce life imprisonment as punishment against those who indulge in adulteration. In a joint operation on July 19, a team of Food and Drug Administration officials from Morena and Bhind districts and a Special Task Force (STF) of state police busted factories manufacturing synthetic milk by adding chemicals and also the centres from where chemicals and raw material were being supplied. Scores of people have been arrested since then and sodium thiosulfate, caustic soda, chloroform, Palmolein oil, hydrogen peroxide, maltodextrin and shampoo among other products have been seized from them. Story continues below this ad After directions from Chief Minister Kamal Nath, chief secretary S R Mohanty in a video conference asked district collectors to crack down on adulterators and continue the campaign. The government has also announced that it will begin a crackdown against those who use chemicals for early ripening of vegetables. From July 20 to July 28, the food safety officials collected 952 samples of milk, milk products and other eatables from across the state and sent them for testing. Admitting that MP has only one food testing laboratory, Silawat said the government is considering setting up laboratories in Jabalpur, Gwalior and Indore. The minister accused the BJP, which ruled the state for 15 years between 2003 and 2018, of doing little to check food adulteration. He said the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government had filed an affidavit in the apex court promising to provide life term for adulteration but did not keep its word. He said between April 2016 and December 2018, the BJP government did not analyze 13,000 food samples because the Bhopal-based laboratory was equipped to only handle 6,000 samples a year. He accused the previous government of surrendering before adulterators and letting them proliferate and put peoples’ lives at stake."

During the month, the staff of restaurants, particularly those from outside Kerala, would be sensitised to the hygiene standards. Awareness sessions would be held for staff and owners. A hygiene monitoring squad of the association would randomly inspect the eateries. Drops stir plan Mr. Moideenkutty said the association had earlier planned to go on an indefinite Statewide shutdown of all eateries in protest against the raids by the Health Department authorities and officials of the municipalities and Corporations on the restaurants. The strike plan has now been dropped. He alleged that the raids had not followed any standard criteria or norms. The officials simply seized allegedly stale food and gave wide bad publicity to the eateries. This was unfair and showed the entire industry in poor light. He said the Food Safety authorities, on the other hand, had their own definition of stale food and had a set of criteria for hygiene.

Greens get a sewage wash, sprayed with pesticide",01-08-2019,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhopal/toxins-in-your-daily-diet-greens-get-a-sewage-wash-sprayed-with-pesticide/articleshow/70476520.cms,"BHOPAL : If you thought more fruits and vegetables in your diet would ensure better health, you may not always be correct. With adulteration rife in fruits and vegetables, consuming them may actually do more harm than good.Environmentalist, Dr Subhash Chandra Pandey says there are so many “carcinogenic” elements in vegetables and fruits nowadays that it has become a major contributory factor for the spurt in cases of cancer in all age groups.Dr Pandey is the one, who had filed a petition in the National Green Tribunal (NGT) seeking a ban on the production of “sewage vegetables” in areas near Shahpura.“The NGT passed several orders intended to ban the production of vegetables from sewage water, but failed to have the desired impact,"" he said while talking to TOI.When told that food & civil supplies minister, Tulsi Silawat, has announced a drive to check adulteration in fruits and vegetables, Dr Pandey said it is much needed. “Gone are the days when vegetables and fruits were supposed to be pure. They are being adulterated or are getting contaminated and what the state intends to do is welcome,” he said.Contaminated soil and water is a major source of adulteration in fruits and vegetables, Dr Pandey said, adding that effluent discharged by industries or households is not only contaminating soil on which fruits/vegetables are being sown, but also the water used to grow them.“Contaminated soil/water goes through the roots to adulterate fruits/vegetables which we innocuously eat to keep ourselves healthy,” he said. The spray of insecticide and pesticide is another source, giving carcinogenic properties to fruits/vegetables.“Insecticide/pesticide, when sprayed, is absorbed by the fruits or vegetables in five to 15 minutes. For example, grapes absorb it in five minutes. In Himachal Pradesh, pesticide/insecticide is sprayed as many as 16 times to keep it safe, and when eaten, it does not conform to the adage ‘An apple a day keeps the doctor away’,” he said.He further said that rivers around Bhopal don’t survive beyond winter and when farmers are short of water, theywash fruits/vegetables with sewage water, which introduces toxic elements in them. “Two years ago, I had tested vegetables from Bittan Market in my lab and found the presence of heavy metals in them, which cause cancer,” he said.Besides, water quality in Kaliasot and Betwa rivers or patra nullah used by farmers in and around Bhopal is so bad that if one bathes in them over a period of time, they are sure to develop one or the other skin disease. So you can imagine the amount of contamination that fruits/vegetables “nourished” in that water will have.When asked about adulteration in fruits/vegetables, dietitian Nidhi Pandey of Diet Chart, said: “Whether adulterated deliberately or not, anything which we eat, including fruits/vegetables, has 40% adulteration. There is contamination in soil, there are soluble and insoluble impurities in water. How do you expect anything sown on that land orwater to be pure? If you have an industry discharging effluents somewhere, it pollutes water and soil in the range of 100-to 150 km and obviously affects any crop,” she said.But, is it pollution in water and soil or use of pesticide and fertiliser, which is contaminating fruits/vegetables or is it being done by vendors, too, using chemicals to prematurely ripen them or preserve them beyond their shelf life?Aslam Mohd. Khan, who is into farming, said: “Fully-ripe papaya , mangoes or bananas that you purchase from a vendor comes earlier in the day or a day or two ago completely unripe. “When green banana is received, it’s put into a plastic containing a chemical and water is added to it and the stack of banana in no time becomes ripe. The chemical used for the purpose is called Carbide. It’s the same chemical which is used for welding. The vapour produced by Carbide’s reaction with water is used for gas welding,” he explained.While Carbide is used to ripen fruits like mangoes, bananas, papaya, grapes and pineapple, oxytocin is used for vegetables. Khan said that the state government’s proposed drive to detect adulteration is a step in the right direction.Joint controller, Food & Drugs Administration, D K Nagendra, said checks to detect the use of Carbide has already begun in Indore. “We are working out a strategy. The controller, food and drugs, is also participating in a meeting to decide on the issue. We shall start sampling of fruits and vegetables soon, though it has already begun at some places in Indore,” he said.Oncologist, Dr Shyam Agrawal said that adulteration of fruits and vegetables has more to do with use of chemicals for their preservation. “If there is a bumper crop of a fruit or a vegetable, their preservation becomes difficult and it’s here that use of chemicals comes into play. “ If the government issues guidelines on chemicals which can be used and which can’t be used, it would be a very wise step because vendors in a majority of cases don’t know themselves what chemical they are using and what effect it could have on health.”President of Bittan Market Vegetable Sellers’ Association, Hariom Khatik, however, said that he could confidently claim that no harmful chemical is used to increase yield of the crop or ripen fruits or vegetables in the 40-km radius around Bhopal.“I can assure you what we are selling you at Bittan Market has no contamination or adulteration. And now, we are selling organic fruits and vegetables also, where we don’t even use fertilizer .” When reminded of sewage vegetable farming, he said: “They have stopped it now. They are into floriculture now.” “As far as sampling of fruits and vegetables is concerned, it has never happened in the past. Let’s see, what the government proposes,” Khatik said."

On Saturday, police arrested four people and seized banned tobacco products worth Rs 1 crore from a container truck near Sriperumbudur .Murugan and Sivakumar, among the arrested men, told police that they had been bringing in banned tobacco products from Bengaluru to supply stores in Chennai and suburban areas in spite of increased police surveillance.From January to May, a police officer said, about 160 smugglers had been arrested and more than two tonnes of gutka and other banned tobacco products seized. All the arrested came out of jail within two weeks as the courts and police didn’t consider the cases severe. Most of the arrested are couriers (‘kuruvis’), getting Rs 1,000-Rs 2,000 for each successful journey from their dealers.A TOI operation with the help of some traders found ‘banned’ gutka worth crores of rupees continues to be freely available in the city, hidden before distribution in godowns in places like Sowcarpet.A shop keeper on GA Road in Washermenpet said big traders sold the stuff only to regular shop keepers, wary of crackdowns by police and food safety officials. Vendors too sold the banned tobacco products only to regular ‘customers’, shooing away unfamiliar faces. Many shopkeepers sold these banned products at a premium a gutka sachet that retails for Rs 10 costing Rs 30-Rs 50.In some police station limits, especially in areas like Gummidipoondi on the TN-AP border, gutka dealers bring in the bundles by hiding them in packets with fake labels from other states while their ‘agents’ intercept them en route and cart them away. The connivance of police personnel in border outposts as well as corporation officials cannot be ruled out in the continuance of the trade, said senior police officers."

The advisory issued on July 22 by Shobhit Jain, FSSAI executive director (compliance division), said, “Considering the safety of the public at large, there is a need to discourage food businesses f rom providing any toy or gift item inside the food packages especially in case of food which is likely to be ingested directly by an infant or a small child. Such promotional free toys or gift items may be provided separately or pac ked separately.” “Also, it is desirable that the colour, texture and nature of toy or gift item should not at all resemble the food product inside food package,” the advis ory said. As per section 3(1) zz(xi) of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 “unsafe food” means an article of food whose nature, substance or quality is so affected as to render it injurious to health by virtue of its being misbranded or sub-standard or food containing extraneous matter. Quoting this provision under the Act, the advisory said: “Commissioner of Food Safety of all States/UTs are requested to make efforts for generating awareness amongst all stakeholders to discourage the practice of packing of such toys/gifts with food products for infants and small children.” Karnataka Health Commissioner Pankaj Kumar Pandey, who is also the Food Safety Commissioner, told The Hindu on Tuesday that Food Safety Officers in the State have been directed to ensure that the advisory is implemented effectively. Pointing out that the advisory has been rightly issued, he said it was taken up for discussion at a recent meeting. “We are keen on popularising this. Manufacturers can offer free toys or gifts, but they should not be packed with the food product. Also, they should be not of similar shape or colour of the food product as children may swallow the tiny toys.” Shashidhar Buggi, former Director of the State-run Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases (RGICD), said he had treated several children who had accidentally swallowed foreign objects. “If an object (small toy or any other gift) is added inside a packet of chips or fryums, the chances of the child swallowing it accidentally are high,” he said. “Swallowing a foreign object may not cause an acute problem in all cases. However, if the object gets stuck in the upper airway it can result in choking and sudden death. If the object manages to go into the bronchus, the child can develop chronic cough. During my tenure at RGICD, I have seen several children who presented with chronic cough. When a child presents with chronic cough, we should first examine if the child has swallowed a foreign object,” he explained."

Justice Anand Venkatesh while passing the order, however, refused to quash the FIR filed against Thangarasu of Namakkal District who was an accused in the case for transporting the banned gutka, pan masala items of 3500 Kgs from Bengaluru. The judge in his order observed, “In so far as the offences under Section 52 & 59 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 is concerned, it indeed provides for a different procedure to prosecute, for those offences, by a designated authority and there is a special statute which lays down the procedure for prosecuting an offence under the said Act. The offences under this Act cannot be investigated by the respondent Police and the respondent Police shall drop these offences in the course of an investigation and leave it to the appropriate authority to take action following the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.” According to the prosecution, the Sub- Inspector of Police, Paramathi Police Station, of Namakkal District on January 14, 2019, stopped a lorry near Keerambur toll plaza and found that it contained the banned items. On enquiry, it was found that it was transported from Bengaluru to the godown owned by the petitioner. The entire property was seized and based on the complaint given by the Sub-Inspector a FIR against four persons under various sections of IPC and COTPA Act, 2003 and Section 52 & 59 of Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 was registered. The court in its order observed that the police are not the competent authority to register the FIR for the offence under the Food Safety and Standards Authorities Act, 2006. Therefore, the charges registered by the police for the offences under Sections 52 & 59 of the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 is not sustainable, said the court."

But we found that people who don’t see the labels eat this butter after it is offered to the god at various temples,” said Chennai food safety officer A Ramakrishnan.Most manufacturers also make edible ghee and butter on the same assembly line. “This is a complete violation of food safety as there is risk of edible food getting mixed with these chemicals,” another official said. Samples of ghee and butter products were seized from these units and sent for analysis.“We will be able to find adulterants they use. We can frame charges against the manufacturers if edible ghee is contaminated and if there are labelling issues,” he said. If the charges are proved, it can lead to cancellation of manufacturing licence besides criminal action.None of the manufacturers reared cows or had dairy farms and bought raw material — white and yellow butter and ghee — from a distributor (name withheld for investigation) in tins. The distributor also gives them 5 litres of a red dye mixed with mustard oil. This goes into ‘white’ butter to give it the colour and texture of cow’s ghee.The chemicals have also been sent for analysis. Last year, food safety officials in Visakhapatnam found manufacturers mixing synthetic resin adhesive such as Fevicol with ghee.Consuming ghee or butter mixed with colouring chemicals and vanaspathi is dangerous. While the chemicals can cause digestive disorders and cancer, the effect of vanaspathi is equally devastating.“It is vegetable ghee that has been hydrogenated and hardened with palmolein. It is high on trans fats, a risk factor for high cholesterol, heart attacks and strokes,” said nutritionist S Bhama.In 2018, the government said 47 major temples in Tamil Nadu run by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department will get Food Safety and Standards Authority of India certification for ‘prasad’. Food safety officials say they check all temples. “We told temple officials and priests not to use inedible substance as offering,” he said."

The authorities on Tuesday seized 205 litres of banned brands of coconut oil kept at a house in Vengeri for being supplied to the shops in the district. Around 800 litres of coconut oil in sealed packets of several brands, that were suspected to be of poor quality, were also seized from there. The samples of these have been sent to the Regional Analytical Laboratory for quality check under the Food Safety and Quality Act. The stock, consisting of several new brands, were found from the house of a manufacturer, whose oil mill at Narikkuni was sealed by the authorities earlier for low quality products. If the seized products were found to be of low quality, action will be taken against the manufacturer under the Food Safety Act. The authorities had earlier issued a warning regarding the presence of banned brands of coconut oil in the market, based on the laboratory tests carried out in May, June and July 2019. Banned brands The Food Safety Assistant Commissioner had banned the sale of ‘Soorya’ and ‘Ayilyam’ brands by Tamil Nadu-based manufacturer ‘Balakumaran’ in July. ‘ Soubhagya’ and ‘Surabhi’, two other brands of the same manufacturer, were banned in the district earlier. The authoritiese had urged the Tamil Nadu government to cancel the licence of the manufacturer for sale of substandard products.

The students, from Class VIII to X, and headmistress Sampada Kirkole were admitted to Bharati Hospital in Katraj. Dr Sanjay Lalwani, medical director at the hospital, said four children were admitted in the paediatric ward, one of whom was in ICU as the child suffered dehydration from severe vomiting. The rest were treated in the out patient department and were stable. They had vomiting and loose motion, and it seems a case of food poisoning, Dr Lalwani said. Kirkole said that the khichdi arrived at the school at 8.45 am. “Around 9 am, I had some of it to ensure it was okay and the food was served around 9.30 am. Soon after, I was told that two children had vomited. I was on the third floor and rushed down, only to find more children taking ill. Even I fell sick. The trustee of the school immediately decided to send the children to Bharati hospital,” she said. Story continues below this ad A Food and Drug Administration (FDA) team collected samples of the khichdi for testing, while issuing ‘stop work’ orders to the Rajmi Mahila Vividh Karyakari Sanstha Maryadit, which supplies mid-day meals to 9,600 students across 23 schools. Explained Need to strictly implement laws The issue of children being served poor quality meals in schools has time and again been raised with little effect. Agencies supplying the meals have to meet deadlines which may affect quality of food. Chances of contamination are high when there is no check on how the food is prepared. In this case, the FDA team found flies and food prepared in unhygienic surroundings. Activists claim that at times these incidents were an outcome of the massive gap between resources provided by the government and quality of work. However, with lives of children at stake, there is a need to strictly implement the Food Safety and Standards Act to protect and promote public health. Sanjay Shinde, Assistant Commissioner, FDA (Pune), who visited the sanstha’s main kitchen at Anant Teerth Cooperative Housing Society in Kondhwa, said the 2,000 sqft place didn’t have packed windows due to which there were several flies inside. The agency has a licence to operate but there was no qualified (diploma or degree holder) expert to supervise the work. Food safety officer Ramakant Kulkarni also found the place dirty. “We have issued ‘stop work’ orders till they meet hygiene and cleanliness standards,” Shinde said. Assistant inspector Shrishail S Chiwadshetty of Bharti Vidyapeeth police station said, “Samples of the food have been collected by FDA officials. Based on the findings, there will be a probe into possible negligence on the part of the entity running the kitchen and also the school. If the probe reveals negligence, legal action may be initiated.” The Poshan Aahar Seva Sanghatana condemned the incident. “We demand strong legal action against PMC officials and employees responsible for awarding contracts to organisations that do not have either the capacity or capability to prepare these meals of required standards,” said Sham Sasane, president of the district unit of the sanghatana. Story continues below this ad Kiran Moghe, secretary, said that such incidents were happening regularly in Maharashtra and across the country. The central kitchen system proposed by the government is unable to provide food as per norms of the mid-day meal scheme, he added. “We hope this incident will force the government to reconsider its decision.” “Despite the fact that women Self Help Groups (SHGs) have consistently and diligently provided mid-day meals to schools for the last several years, certain employees and officials in the PMC have colluded to take away their work and awarded it to large contractors,” it said in a statement, adding that conditions set by the government and the PMC (Rs 40 lakh turnover, Rs 15 lakh deposit and 2,000 sqft area) have kept SHGs out of the process. “The PMC should cancel these contracts and blacklist these organisations before more harm is done to children. We demand that the work should once again be awarded to SHGs, the statement added."

According to the police, 2,000 litres of ‘fake’ petrol and 2 lakh litres of chemicals used for adulteration have been recovered from the premises of thinner and solvent factories and godowns in the Partapur area of Meerut where the accused were allegedly carrying out the criminal activity. A truck that was being used to supply the ‘fake’ petrol to at least 10 different petrol pumps in the city has also been seized. Alok Singh, I-G Police (Meerut Range), had asked the Crime Branch and local police to look into complaints of farmers about the engines of their tractors and tube well machines getting seized after buying diesel from certain petrol pumps in the city. “On the basis of clues provided by an informer, we conducted raids at Paras Chemical Factory and Ganpati Petrochem and recovered hundreds of litres of chemicals and spurious petrol and diesel on Tuesday night,” said Avinash Pandey, SP (Rural) Meerut. Proprietors booked The police arrested Rajiv Jain, proprietor, Paras Chemicals, and Pradeep Gupta, who owns Ganesh Petrochem, and eight others under Sections 420 of IPC and 3/7 of the Essential Commodities Act 1955. During interrogation, the accused revealed the modus operandi. “The two kingpins had licence to make thinner in their factories. They would add colour that is commonly used in making savouries to the chemical to ‘create’ the spurious fuel,” the police said. It allegedly cost them ₹38 a litre. They would supply it to petrol pumps in the city and neighbouring States in their truck. “We asked them to show the process in police presence and they said if 20% of it is added to original petrol, it is hard to detect its presence by a common consumer,” Mr. Pandey added. The police have informed the Indian Oil Corporation to take action against the colluding petrol pumps and three petrol pumps were raided on Thursday by officials of the district supply office."

Crime Branch officials said the arrests were made by Unit IX on the basis of a tip-off. A team led by police inspector Asha Korke raided three rooms — 35, 84, 279 and 291 — of Versova Ekta Society in New Bharatnagar in Andheri (West). The raid was conducted in collaboration with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials at 5.30 a.m. A Crime Branch officer said, “The team identified the location and raided it early in the morning as milk is supplied at that time. Four people, who were running the racket, attempted to flee, but our officers gave chase and managed to nab them.” The accused, who have been identified as Lingaswami Bulachi (29), Sayalu Nomala (53), Shrinivas Pabbu (40) and Yaadgari Kandikatala (48), were arrested and 500 litres of adulterated milk worth ₹35,000 was seized from them. The police also seized equipment used by the accused to open branded packets, add water to them, pour the adulterated contents in counterfeit packets and reseal them. The officer said, “The accused procured milk packets of brands such as Amul, Gokul and Mother Diary and emptied them into huge buckets. The milk was then mixed with dirty water and repacked in fake pouches. They are estimated to have made profits of about ₹10,000 per day.” Another officer said Mr. Bulachi is a repeat offender and was arrested by the Versova police for committing a similar offence last year. He was later externed from the police station’s jurisdiction. The officer said, “We are interrogating the accused on their distribution network, source of the milk pouches, and similar rackets in the city. Such rackets flourish because the accused restart the business from another location once they are out on bail. Adulteration of milk is a serious racket as children are among the biggest consumers of milk.” The seized milk was later destroyed in the presence of FDA officials."

Political opposition to Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s move to suspend Parliament is crystalizing with protests around Britain and a petition to block the move gaining more than 1 million signatures. (AP Photo/Vudi Xhymshiti) Could Brexit bring America’s “chlorinated chicken” to the United Kingdom? The European Union has long refused to import poultry from the United States that is routinely rinsed with chemical washes to kill germs. But the United Kingdom’s planned exit from the EU is putting the practice back in the spotlight, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson even taunting Labor Party leader Jeremy Corbyn by calling him a “chlorinated chicken.” The term has come to sum up concerns that Britain could be pressured to accept to looser food safety standards when negotiating its own post-Brexit trade deals. Story continues below this ad Unlike in the EU, the use of antimicrobial sprays and washes is widespread in the US chicken industry. Companies apply them to kill germs at various stages during processing, such as when carcasses are de-feathered, gutted or any other point when feces could splatter and spread germs like salmonella. The chemicals used in rinses have to be approved by the US Department of Agriculture, and their use is limited to specified amounts. The agency says the rinses are present in finished products at insignificant levels. Story continues below this ad The US chicken industry says the use of chlorine has declined to about 10 per cent of the country’s plants, as other chemicals have become more common. It says the rinses help improve food safety, but that it’s difficult to completely rid raw chicken of salmonella and campylobacter germs, which don’t sicken birds and are commonly found in their guts. “Chicken and campylobacter are best friends,” said Ashley Peterson of the National Chicken Council, an industry group. Campylobacter (kam-pih-loh-BAK’-tur) isn’t widely known in the US but is a major cause of food poisoning. Story continues below this ad Critics of food safety regulation in the US say the use of antimicrobial washes and sprays underscores how widespread the bacteria are in raw chicken, especially considering the persistence of food poisoning outbreaks. Tony Corbo of Food and Water Watch, a group that has called for stricter meat regulations, said the rinses could be used to mask broader sanitary problems during production. Though it’s legal to sell raw chicken with salmonella and campylobacter in supermarkets, the USDA tries to control germs with standards on how much can be in the raw chicken tested at processing plants. The salmonella standard is around 10 per cent for whole bird carcasses, and about 15 per cent for raw chicken parts, which have a higher chance of being exposed to feces during chopping. Story continues below this ad It’s why health officials stress the need for safe handling of raw poultry, such as thoroughly cooking the meat to kill potential germs. They also warn people should not rinse raw chicken, which can spray bacteria everywhere. Germs in raw chicken are an issue in the UK too. Health officials have been working to lower rates of campylobacter, which is the most common cause of food poisoning in the country. But testing in 2017 found its presence in more than half of raw chicken sold in stores. Story continues below this ad In a statement, the UK’s Food Standards Agency said chlorine washes can be used on fresh produce like salad, but not on meat or animal products. It noted only water can be used to remove surface contamination from poultry carcasses in EU countries. Those rules will stay in place after the UK leaves the EU, the agency said, and any potential change would involve “a rigorous risk assessment.” Timothy Lytton, a professor of law who researches food safety at Georgia State University, noted antimicrobial washes are used for other foods in the US, including produce. Story continues below this ad And he said their use with raw chicken might be because of the massive scale of the country’s poultry production, which might make approaches used in other parts of the world impractical. Still, Lytton said worries in the United Kingdom and Europe about “chlorinated chicken” underscore larger anxieties about the ongoing industrialisation of the food supply. “People are anxious about the fact that industry is making their food,” he said."

MEERUT : Blowing the lid off a big scam, the district administration on Sunday unearthed 70,000 litre of kerosene oil stored in illegal underground tankers in Meerut’s Partapur area. The underground tankers were owned by a local businessman, Sanjay Agarwal, and managed by Vicky, who goes by his first name.“Based on a complaint by the local administration, an FIR against owner Sanjay Agarwal and manager Vicky has been registered under the Essential Commodities Act,"" Meerut senior superintendent of police (SSP) Ajay Sahni said.According to officials, the seized kerosene was in excess of sanctioned limit of 48,000 litre to the firm.""Based on the complaint of the local administration, an FIR against owner Sanjay Agarwal and manager Vicky has been registered under essential commodities act,"" Meerut SSP Ajay Sahni said.Meanwhile, soon after the raid, accused businessman Agrawal attempted suicide by consuming poison. He was rushed to a private hospital in Ghaziabad where his condition is said to be stable.Agrawal's lawyer Ram Kumar Sharma claimed that his client is being unnecessarily harassed by the administration.“The only charge against our client is of over stocking. A senior official from the local administration is always present both during unloading of kerosene from tankers and its sale from public ration shops,” lawyer Sharma said.“They could have initiated a probe against it, but the local administration is levelling unsubstantiated allegations against Agarwal, which forced him to attempt suicide,"" Sharma added.The crackdown comes close on the heels of adulterated petrol scam where more than 2 lakh litres of adulterants was seized from a firm on August 20 in Partapur area.Soon after the raid, police formed a special investigative team and the local administration launched a magisterial probe amid complaints of widespread adulteration of fuel, mising of kerosene in petrol and diesel, at filling stations.Recently, police had discovered that most of the chemical firms involved in the illicit business have been diverting industrial chemicals to shell companies which, in turn, have been manufacturing adulterants that can be easily mixed with petrol or diesel.Sources told TOI that several such rackets have come up in the city in the past one decade and have been operating with impunity in connivance with local politicians and officials of supply department in the local administration.District magistrate Anil Dhingra has already order magisterial probe which will also so look into the role of officials of supply department over the years."

The dairies already have have ISO 9001:2005, HACCP certification (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point is an internationally accepted technique for preventing microbiological, chemical and physical contamination along the food supply chain) and FSSC 22000 certification. “Stage I audit has been completed for these dairies. Recently, our Tiruvannamalai dairy that also has the capability to process milk into whole milk powder and butter, got the FSSC 22000 certification — Food Safety System Certification,” explained C. Kamaraj, Managing Director, Aavin. For safe products “This is a certification of our food safety management system that provides assurance to consumers that we have implemented systems that consistently provide safe products. The certificate for the Tiruvannamalai plant that also processes ghee is valid till July 30, 2022,” he said. This certification, the latest version of international standards, provides Aavin a systematic method for analysing food processes, determining possible hazards, and designating the critical control points. The steps are necessary to prevent unsafe food from reaching the consumer, he said. It also helps Aavin to increase its customer base, especially among foreign customers, he said. “The U.S. and other countries have this certification as a requirement for food products. The Global Food Safety Initiative recognises this system too,” he said. The Tamil Nadu Cooperative Milk Producers Federation, whose brand is Aavin, has been ensuring certification at all its dairies to provide quality food products to consumers. “We began five years ago and all our dairies have some kind of certification and we constantly upgrade them to ensure quality, which is very important in the food industry. The dairy at Tiruvannamalai also has an export licence for milk powder and ghee,” Mr. Kamaraj said.

thehindu.com,cities,Check on adulterated palm jaggery,17-09-2019,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/check-on-adulterated-palm-jaggery/article29442267.ece,"Following complaints regarding widespread adulteration of palm jaggery in the district, the Food Safety Department has planned to crack down on manufacturers making adulterated jaggery, as time sought by producers and traders to comply with the norms came to an end on September 15. The adulteration affects consumers, many of whom suffer from various ailments like diabetes, who consider palm jaggery a healthy alternative to sugar. But sugar, which is a cheaper sweetener, found its way into palm jaggery as an adulterant. “For long, a section of producers have been selling adulterated palm jaggery. Due to lack of labelling of ingredients in retail sale, there is no transparency,” says V. Gunaselan, a social activist in Udangudi, which is well known for its ‘panakarupatti.’ “While jaggery can be produced for a few months from March to August, those who adulterate the product continue to produce it round the year.” It makes production of unadulterated palm jaggery unsustainable for producers. “The price of jaggery in the market suffers steep cut due to cheaper adulterated product,” says A. Ravi of Thoothukudi South District Vanigar Sangangalin Peravai, who also produces palm jaggery. “It has become more difficult to find palm tappers, who continue to leave the profession. As a result, migrant workers are brought from places like Nagercoil and wages go up making the business unsustainable,” he says. Following an amendment to the Food Safety and Standards Regulations, standards for jaggery and cane jaggery were created. The norms have a clear distinction between jaggery, prepared from palmyra palm, date palm or coconut palm, and cane jaggery made by boiling or processing juice pressed from sugarcane. In August, based on the instruction of the Collector after complaints, two meetings were held in Thoothukudi with producers and traders. “Only if jaggery is produced from pathaneer and not mixed with sugar, should it be labeled as panakarupatti (palm jaggery) or panakarkandu (palm candy or misri). Even if one % of sugar is mixed, it would be considered as adulterated, and the inventory will be seized,” officials told the stakeholders during the meeting. Various other instructions including implementation of good hygienic practices in manufacturing, labelling clearly whether it is palm or cane jaggery, both in Tamil and English, installation of a pest control system were given to producers and retailers. R. Karunakaran, Designated Officer for Food Safety, said only 27 out of about 180 manufacturers in the district have valid licences. “Some producers have started labelling their products in compliance with the norms,” he says. He said the department would collect samples from producers, wholesale distributors and retail shops, who would be fined a minimum of ₹1 lakh, if found to be not complying with the norms. Dr. Karunakaran has a few tips for consumers. “Unadulterated palm jaggery would not be very hard, and would be less sweet compared to adulterated one. On exposure to air, it would become sticky and will be medium brown in colour. As pathaneer has lime content, it would have a slight bitter taste,” he says."

The Mumbai Police Crime Branch has busted a racket where oxytocin, a chemical used for increasing milk production in milch animals, was being supplied to dairy farmers in the three cities, and seized massive quantities of the chemical. According to Crime Branch officers, the racket was busted after the Unit X received information about it. On Tuesday, police constable Sachin Thombre received a tip-off that a large consignment of oxytocin would be transported through Powai and a team led by police inspector Sunil Mane, in-charge of the unit, laid a trap. Transported in taxi “We intercepted a taxi driving through Powai on Aarey Road and searched it, after which we found 100 litres of oxytocin in 1,000 glass bottles inside the vehicle. Two suspects who were in the vehicle were taken into custody for questioning,” a Crime Branch officer said. The duo, identified as Najib Khotal (37) and Anees Khande (44), allegedly confessed that they were taking the chemical to be sold to dairy farmers in the area, and were arrested. “Based on the interrogation of the duo, we went on to raid a godown in Kalyan, where they stay, and seized another of 500 litres of the chemical, which was stored in five barrels. We also arrested the godown owner, identified as Sadik Khot (37),” the officer said. He said inquiries so far have established that the oxytocin was sourced from West Bengal and was being supplied to dairy farmers all over Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Thane. The accused have confessed that they have been active for at least four to five years, and the police are now working to identify the dairy farmers who were buying the oxytocin from them, officers said. Oxytocin is injected in milch cows and buffaloes to increase the amount of milk that they produce naturally. The milk obtained by injecting oxytocin has several harmful side effects, including early onset of puberty in girls and lack of testosterone in boys. It is also harmful for pregnant women. Due to its harmful effects, the chemical is a controlled substance in India and its sale and purchase requires a license from the government. The trio have been charged with adulteration of food or drink for sale under the Indian Penal Code along with sections of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act and the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, officers said."

thehindu.com,cities,Dusty roads turn two-wheeler riders dusky,11-10-2019,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/dusty-roads-turn-two-wheeler-riders-dusky/article29660160.ece,"K. Saravanan, a delivery boy, who travels around 100 kilometers in his two-wheeler across the city everyday, says that at the end of each trip his face gets covered with dust and his mouth tastes of mud. “At the end of each day, my eyes burn and I also have irritation,” he says. With the ongoing construction activities and improper upkeep of roads across the city, dust pollution has become a major issue plaguing motorists. Despite steps taken by authorities to address the issue at key locations where construction activities are undertaken, like Periyar Bus Stand, Kalavasal and New Natham Road, road users complain of intolerable amount of dust at these locations. A traffic police constable at the Kalavasal junction says that wearing face mask has not given relief from respiratory ailments. “We stand at these junctions for eight hours a day and most of us suffer from cold, throat infection and skin allergies frequently,” he says. A senior official from the National Highway Authority of India says that water is sprayed at regular intervals on the New Natham Road to contain dust pollution. “Within two months, work on laying bitumen road along the stretch will commence and it will provide some respite,” he says. Apart from locations where construction activities are under progress, several bus routes in the city are also dusty. Driving through stretches like Vakkil New Street, Kamarajar Salai, Tirupparankundram Road, Arapalayam Cross Road and Anaiyur Road has become difficult, complain two-wheeler riders. “While we ride across these roads, the floating dust particles enter our eyes and they increase the possibility of freak accidents,” says S. Kanagaraj, a motorist. S. Rajamohan, Managing Director of Enviro Care India, a laboratory accredited by National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories, explains that there are four major indicators for measuring the quality of air - Particulate Matter (PM) 2.5, PM 10, level of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide . He says that dusty roads are the main reason for high levels of PM 2.5 and PM 10 at main junctions like the Periyar Bus Stand, Goripalayam and Kalavasal. While the permissible limit of PM 2.5 pollutants is 60 microns/cubic metre, the levels are as high as 100 at these junctions. For PM 10 pollutants, the permissible limit is 100 microns/cubic metre, but the levels are around 160 at these locations. He also says that sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide are under permissible limits. Dust entering the human body can cause asthma, allergies and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, says V.P. Arivudai Nambi, Associate Professor, Department of Pulmonary Medicine, Government Rajaji Hospital. “Continuous inhalation of dust particles is more hazardous than smoking tobacco,” he adds. The other area of concern is the exposure of food of roadside eateries to dust particles. Designated Officer of Food Safety, Madurai district, M. Somasundaram, says that over 10,000 roadside eateries are present across the city. “We have instructed them to ensure that all food items are placed in a glass compartment to avoid contamination. We are also planning to conduct a programme to sensitise these vendors to food safety and hygiene,” he says. Intake of contaminated food can cause diarrhoea, infections in the intestines and severe stomach pain, says V.N. Alagavenkatesan, a consultant physician."

thehindu.com,cover-story,Feeding lessons to tackle malnutrition,23-10-2019,https://frontline.thehindu.com/cover-story/article29766390.ece,"T he release of the Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey (CNNS 2016-2018) has renewed interest in tackling malnutrition in India. The conceptual framework for child undernutrition, developed by UNICEF, recognises breastfeeding, good complementary feeding, caring and health care to minimise disease burden as immediate underlying factors that determine malnutrition in all its forms. According to the CNNS, 35 per cent of the children under five were stunted (HAZ <-2 SD), 17 per cent were wasted (WHZ <-2 SD), and 33 per cent were underweight (WAZ <-2 SD). India has set ambitious targets to annually reduce stunting to 25 per cent by 2022. In the past decade the focus of dealing with malnutrition has been tilting in favour of treating severe malnutrition with ready-to-use therapeutic foods (RUTF), projected as a magic solution for saving babies. However, a recent study from eastern India concluded: “Given that the risk of mortality is lower than expected among children older than 6 months and that many deaths occur because of prematurity or low birth weight during the neonatal period, outpatient treatment for SAM [severe acute malnutrition] using RUTF for children over 6 months may be too late to avert a substantial number of deaths from undernutrition in Indian children. This further strengthens the case for prioritising prevention through known health, nutrition, and multisectoral interventions in the first 1,000 days of life.” Nutrition action in India needs a rethink and reassessment. Some fundamental corrections are needed to change the focus from treatment to prevention. One key approach is to ensure optimal feeding practices during the first 24 months of life. These are critical to a child’s survival, health, nutrition and development, not because children are vulnerable at this age but because their brains develop almost entirely in the first two years. The practices include initiating breastfeeding within an hour of birth and skin-to-skin contact with the mother immediately after birth, exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months, and continued breastfeeding along with adequate complementary feeding thereafter until two years or beyond. Fundamental corrections are suggested in policy and programme to ensure optimal practices more on how to do rather than what to do, given that the Government of India is seized of the matter in principle. The proposed corrections are also based on our findings and analysis of the hospital practices in relation to breastfeeding. If we made these corrections, they are likely to bring a shift towards preventive health care much needed by every child of new India, and rapidly reduce malnutrition. Why focus on optimal feeding practices? According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), non-exclusive breastfeeding and inadequate complementary feeding contribute to stunting and are among the important causes of wasting. An international study on the cost of not breastfeeding estimates that in India, inadequate breastfeeding results in 1,00,000 preventable child deaths (mainly due to diarrhoea and pneumonia), 34.7 million cases of diarrhoea, 2.4 million cases of pneumonia, and 40,382 cases of obesity. The health impact on mothers translates into more than 7,000 cases of breast cancer, 1,700 of ovarian cancer and 87,000 of type 2 diabetes. India spends Rs.727.18 crore on health care to battle illness. Optimal feeding has the potential to simultaneously reduce the risk or burden of both undernutrition and excess weight, obesity or diet-related non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and some cancers. Improving breastfeeding rates has been explicitly stated to contribute to attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 2030 of health, nutrition, education, poverty, reducing inequalities, and inclusive economic growth. India is committed to SDGs. The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare launched the “Breastfeeding and IYCF Report Card” in August 2019, which counts on these three feeding practices. The report card is based on the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-4). Table 1 shows how India performs on the coverage of three indicators stipulated under NFHS and CNNS. Infant feeding practices are “inadequate” despite an overwhelming evidence of its impact on human health. It leaves more than one crore infants out of the safety net every year right during their first few months of life. These are the ones who slip into various degrees of malnutrition. Several factors contribute to inadequate infant feeding practices. Inadequate attention to policy and programmes for removing barriers to optimal feeding practices; inadequate planning and budget allocation; poor support to women in public and private health facilities; continued aggressive promotion of commercial baby foods; and inadequate structural support to women in both formal and informal workplaces are some of them. India made some headway in addressing the problem in the past decade, but the implementation of existing policies should be strengthened and programmatic interventions should be scaled up. In 2018, the World Breastfeeding Trends Initiative (WBTi), which assesses the state of policies and programmes in over 100 countries, launched its fifth report for India. It showed persistently weak attention to crucial policy and programme areas. Figure 1 shows how India fares on all the 10 indicators of policy and programmes out of a score of 10. The colour coding is based on scores, green, blue, yellow and red in descending order of performance. India is way behind, at number 78 out of 97 countries. A major correction is needed. Reaching all children and pregnant and lactating women with services they need to succeed is imperative. Protect, promote and support optimal feeding There are policy and programme areas that need to be examined and attended to. A critical area is the commercial influence of baby food companies on women and families. For over four decades, the World Health Assembly has recognised that commercial marketing of baby foods is a health hazard for infants. In India, the Infant Milk Substitutes Feeding Bottles, and Infant Foods (Regulation of Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 1992, amended in 2003, bans the promotion of baby food for children under the age of two. Even after 27 years of this legal protection, the enforcement of this law is weak. Big food companies continue to illegally sponsor research and meetings of health workers, thereby influencing their behaviour towards use of infant formula for babies. No wonder that formula feeding is rampant at the time of birth. Babies born by caesarean section usually get formula at birth, instead of having their mothers receive support for breastfeeding. The government’s key agencies such as the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) continue to partner with such companies and provide legitimacy. State governments have been found to rely on programmes sponsored by baby food companies. Our recent findings from hospitals revealed very weak awareness of the IMS Act. The task of implementing the IMS Act should be decentralised at the district level by authorising officers, funds should be allocated for making people aware, and compliance with the Act should be monitored. Government departments and agencies should keep baby food manufacturers and their allies at arm’s length. A critical policy intervention would be to ensure structural support for lactating mothers in order to enable them to combine breastfeeding and work. In 2017, India revised the Maternity Benefit Act of 1961 to provide 26 weeks of maternity leave and breastfeeding breaks. This Act extends to workers of mines, tea plantations, shops and establishments, as per a clarification issued by the Ministry. However, more than 90 per cent of women work in the unorganised sector. The Pradhan Mantri Matritva Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) provides a cash compensation of Rs.5,000 to women for the firstborn child. The scheme should be made universal under the provisions of the National Food Security Act, 2013. The IMS Act mandates reaching out to all pregnant and lactating women with accurate and unbiased information. While information campaigns are there, especially during specified months, face-to-face skilled counselling for each pregnant and lactating woman is the missing piece, as confirmed by recent findings from hospitals. Counselling means helping a mother decide on the best way of feeding her infant instead of just telling her to breastfeed. Counselling helps women build their confidence in their own milk supply. The WHO in 2018 provided guidelines for counselling women on when to breastfeed, how and with what frequency (Table 2) and recommended face-to-face counselling. Antenatal counselling on breastfeeding seems to be rare. The health care system should initiate breastfeeding within an hour of birth and support women to provide skin-to-skin contact with their babies. Exclusive breastfeeding requires multi-sectoral support spread over health, women and child development, labour, disaster management, HIV monitoring and information and broadcasting. While babies are still in hospitals after birth, mothers need skilled support to maintain exclusive breastfeeding. While the government has recognised the need of lactation support in the hospitals, new recruitments are not encouraged. A dedicated skilled lactation counsellor in a hospital can certainly make a huge difference to early breastfeeding rates and also control the use of unnecessary infant formula. Outreach counselling for the quality of complementary feeding is critical after an infant is six months old. According to the CNNS report, timely complementary feeding was initiated for 53 per cent of infants aged six to eight months; only 21 per cent were fed an adequately diverse diet; and 6 per cent received a minimum acceptable diet (which includes both frequency and diversity). This raises a serious question on how we deal with this situation. It is important to monitor how children are fed and how they grow. Dietary assessment for an individual child should be institutionalised. If the child is not getting four or more food groups in the diet, counselling is required and the diet must be compensated in poor households. Monitoring a child’s growth trajectory is another step. At least four nutrition and lactation counsellors should be recruited at the block level to play a mentoring role for community-level health workers such as ASHA, ANM and AWW and to conduct and supervise individual dietary assessments and growth monitoring of each child born in the block. The way forward India needs to ensure that these services reach every pregnant and lactating mother. The existing health system must be strengthened at the block level and in each health facility. Specially trained workers can turn the tide on malnutrition. Children should be fed diverse foods instead of being given dietary fortifications. Strengthening counselling services may cost about Rs.1 crore for every district annually. It is an expenditure that the Central and State governments should bear in the interest of building a new India and future brain power. A plan of action should be documented, with yearly actions and budgets, a coordinating mechanism, and a national scheme for protection and promotion of breastfeeding and complementary feeding. The WHO, UNICEF and World Bank recommend that an estimate of at least $4.7 (Rs.335) per newborn baby is required to achieve high rates of feeding indicators. India could do local estimates and fix a budget line in its health accounts. The answer may lie in a Prime Minister’s Stanpan Suraksha and Samvardhan Yojana (PMSSSY). Will it be helpful if India invests in promoting breastfeeding? The answer is yes. A comparison with Sri Lanka in the WBTi report card tells us why. Table 3 reflects on the 10 policies and programmes in which Sri Lanka scores high in almost all areas and maintains a high rate of exclusive breastfeeding. India scored a low 45 out of 100, whereas Sri Lanka scored 91. Sri Lanka scored green code in eight indicators and became the first country in the world to achieve a “green” colour code by the WBTi. This could well be one of the critical components of getting the health and nutrition indicators right in Sri Lanka.

thehindu.com,cities,Officials discuss ways to curtail sale of edible oil in loose,31-10-2019,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Madurai/officials-discuss-ways-to-curtail-sale-of-edible-oil-in-loose/article29835720.ece,"Officers of the Food Safety department across blocks in Madurai on Wednesday attended a meeting to discuss ways of curtailing sale of edible oil sold in loose in the district. Edible oil, which is not packaged, is prohibited for sale under the Food Safety and Standards (Prohibition and Restriction on Sales) Regulation, 2011. Designated Officer for Food Safety M. Somasundaram said there was steady mushrooming of shops flouting rules and selling oil in loose lately. “Usually, palm oil makes its way into the city and is sold under the name of sesame oil after using adulterants. The commodity is sold for cheap and is easy to procure,” he pointed out. The officer added that the sale of poor quality of edible oil would lead to several health implications, particularly heart-related ailments. “The sale of such products are targeted at those who are from socially backward classes. All unrefined palm oil is filled with trans fat and is bad for health,” Mr. Somasundaram said. The meeting with officers was intended at drawing up a list of shops in each of the blocks in Madurai selling oil in loose and for identifying spaces to store seized oil, the officer said. Dr. Somasundaram said that shopkeepers usually sold the oil under the pretext of helping the environment. “We often hear them saying that they avoid the use of plastic by pouring oil into containers that their customers bring. This is a farce.” The food safety officer added that the department had already launched an exercise in curtailing sale of loose oil."
indiatimes.com,city,Crackdown soon on loose sale of cooking oil,31-10-2019,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/madurai/crackdown-soon-on-loose-sale-of-cooking-oil/articleshow/71828095.cms,"Representative image Food safety officials are planning to crack down on the loose sale of cooking oil which has been banned by the food safety and standards authority of India since August 2011. A large number of shops in Madurai city and rural areas sell adulterated groundnut and gingelly oil in loose, which is used for cooking purpose.Although adulteration of the oil sold in loose is rampant, food safety officials find it difficult to crack the whip on its perpetrators due to the legal impediments in proving that the oil sold is meant for cooking purpose.Officials say it would be easier for them to ensure fair manufacturing and trade practices once the practice is stopped. Designated officer for food safety in the district, Dr M Somasundaram, said, “Essence is mixed with palm oil to sell it as groundnut and gingelly oil. Selling palm oil is legal but not the practice of selling it as other oil varieties. The practice is rampant in loose oil sales. I have briefed food safety officers in the district at a meeting today on how to go about it. Oil kept in vessels for sales will be seized.”He said that the rule applies for cold pressed oils too. While its makers have a manufacturer licence, the only thing they have to do is sell them in sealed packets and containers with all the details as per packing rules. Somasundaram said in this regard higher authorities in the food safety department had conveyed a strong message to the oil manufacturers and traders at the third state-level oil committee meeting in Chennai recently. Many traders offered the lame excuse that they indirectly helped the environment by avoiding plastic by selling loose oil and hence should be allowed to carry on in the traditional way. However, the department found that not many customers carried containers while buying oil and ended up packing it in banned plastics only, he said.There was a time when traders used to sell only unadulterated food items, but ethics are not followed at present. They estimate that almost half the quantity of oil sold in Madurai is in loose. A list of traders who sell loose oil has been prepared from the information obtained from wholesalers. They will initiate action once the place required to store the seized oil is readied, said Somasundaram. He also said that action against loose oil does not mean that all packed oil varieties are safe and free of adulteration. The intention is to streamline the trade so that it will be easier to ensure quality and check if there is a complaint by a customer, the officials said."

On Saturday, officials of the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) checked two shops near a school at Irugur and seized around three kg of banned tobacco products of different brands. Police also say that there were several incidents wherein they seized sachets of banned tobacco products from shops close to educational institutions in the city too. The law prohibits the sale of any tobacco products within a radius of 100 yards of any educational institution. In the case of Saturday’s seizure, the two shops were found with tobacco products like gutkha – manufacture, possession and sale of which is prohibited in Tamil Nadu like many other States. According to L. Balaji Saravanan, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Coimbatore City, police have been doing regular checks to prevent the sale of prohibited tobacco products. He said the city police had so far registered 1,250 cases this year under the provisions of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act (COTPA), 2003. Sources with Coimbatore District (Rural) Police said that nearly 1,000 cases were also registered in the rural limits for sale and possession of banned tobacco products. According to police, illegal manufacturing of banned tobacco products was contained in the district when they busted a panmasala unit at Kannampalayam near Sulur on April 28, 2018 and seized 648 kg of gutka in sachets apart from the raw materials. The panmasala unit owned by Amit Jain of New Delhi manufactured the banned products while he was given permits to manufacture only non-tobacco based products. “Banned tobacco products are now trafficked in private vehicles and inter-State buses. There had been incidents wherein workers from other States were used as carriers to transport banned tobacco products,” said a senior police officer. In May 2018, the FSSAI seized 840 kg of banned tobacco products worth around ₹ 6.44 lakh when the consignment was being trafficked from Bengaluru to Coimbatore in two mini goods carriers. In December 2017, FSSAI officials had seized prohibited tobacco products worth over ₹ 10 lakh from an omni bus operating from Bengaluru to Coimbatore. Recent seizures of banned tobacco products in large quantity by the FSSAI from warehouses in Coimbatore suggest that the supply of the contraband from other States is yet to be contained. K. Tamilselvan, Designated Officer of the FSSAI in Coimbatore, said that packets of gutka seized in recent raids had little whereabouts of the manufacturer. “The sachets seized in surprise raids did not have details of the manufacturer, date of manufacture or batch number. Hence, tracing the manufacturer or place of manufacture is a tough task,” he said. Dr. Tamilselvan added that discussions were also in progress to form a steering committee chaired by the District Collector and officials from various departments, including the police, to enforce prohibition of banned tobacco products in Coimbatore. With some of the offenders getting repeatedly booked for stocking banned tobacco products, the FSSAI plans to request the Collector to invoke provisions of the Goondas Act against such persons."

The bananas, worth ₹10 lakh, were destroyed in the bio methanisation plant inside the market complex. Designated Officer A. Ramakrishnan said that a plant growth hormone was found to be directly sprayed on the fruits to speed up the ripening process. “Direct spraying is not permitted under the Food Safety Standards Act. Hence, the shops were issued notices under Sections 55, 57 and 50 of the Act. It usually takes three-four days for the fruit to ripen naturally but when you spray this, it will take just anywhere between 12-24 hours to become fully ripe. But this also reduces the shelf life of the fruit,” he said. The early morning raids were conducted by 10 food safety officers at 34 shops after watching these establishments for 10 days. Samples of artificially ripened bananas were sent to the Food Analytical Lab for further analysis, he said. Though awareness programmes were being conducted among traders in the market, of late some were found to violate rules. “We started getting information regarding artificial ripening, which is why we conducted the raids,” Dr. Ramakrishnan said. Meanwhile, fruit shops running without valid Food Safety and Standards Authority of India Licence/Registration were served notices."

The solution was then sprayed over the fruit and kept inside airtight rooms to speed up the ripening process.Designated food safety official A Ramakrishnan said several boxes of chemical packed in 100ml bottles were seized from the shops.“The use of ethylene in gas form is allowed. But direct contact with the fruit leads to harmful chemical contamination,” he said.The seized fruit would be destroyed in the biomechanisation plant at Koyambedu.Ethylene – a hormone produced naturally -- is permitted for artificial ripening provided the concentration does not exceed 100 ppm (parts per million).

The findings revealed the growing need for better enforcement of rules by authorities and improved vigil among consumers to ensure safe, healthy and sustainable food in the district. Rectification notices Interestingly, about 41% of the food outlets inspected since April 1 were issued rectification notices after the Department officials found violations of the provisions prescribed by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI). Of the 1,681 establishments inspected, 681 were issued notices. Sixty-three of the 260 samples taken for examination were found to be unsafe or substandard for consumption or misbranded. The Department had slapped a penalty of ₹8.08 lakh on food business operators in the district while the fine imposed by the Revenue Divisional Officer (Adjudicating officer) was ₹4.2 lakh. It had initiated prosecution measures against 36 operators since April. The use of synthetic colours in various food items was found in the samples taken for examination during routine inspection. Synthetic colour “The addition of synthetic food colour in prepared food was noticed in the inspections conducted by the food safety officers across the 14 Assembly constituencies in Ernakulam. The department has asked the food business operators to avoid the use of synthetic colour and monosodium glutamate (MSG),” said Jacob Thomas, Assistant Commissioner of Food Safety, Ernakulam. Even though the FSSAI has listed out the permitted colours, most food business operators fail to comply with it, fearing that consumers may not buy food items for lack of visual appearance. Many cooks appointed by the operators remain ignorant of the guidelines issued by the food safety authority and often use non-permitted colours or mix permitted and non-permitted colours, according to the officials. “Take the case of sugar-based confections such as kesari or laddoo that come out in various colours. We have certain sensory traits that look out for particular colour and smell in various foods. The colour chosen has an impact on our perception of the food,” said V.N. Sivasankara Pillai, former director of the School of Environmental Studies at the Cochin University of Science and Technology (Cusat). Urging consumers to take time out and read the names of ingredients mentioned on packed food items, Mr. Pillai said there would at least be five synthetic chemicals added in preserved foods. “While chemicals are used in such cases, materials like cassava starch and dyes are used to enhance the colour of turmeric powder sold in the market. Care should be taken while giving such adulterated products, especially to children,” he said. Food poisoning Stating that at least three to four children visited him a week with symptoms of food contamination, S. Sachidananda Kamath, former president of the Indian Academy of Peadiatricians, said it could have been caused either by the consumption of sweets or from food consumed from eateries. “Food poisoning occurs owing to various factors like use of contaminated water, poor quality of oil, etc. The lack of proper hygiene in storage of meat and vegetables may also trigger the problem. The main symptoms include vomiting, stomach cramps and abdominal pain,” he said. Urging parents to ensure that children ate food only from eateries that maintained proper hygiene and health standards, Dr. Kamath said care should be taken to use only clean and dry plates and cutlery. “The management of the eateries must also ensure that the staff always wash their hands. The overall hygiene of the employees must be given top priority,” he said. On why the Corporation’s Health wing was not publishing the list of food business operators that violated food safety standards, Health Standing Committee chairperson Pratibha Ansari said the civic body was yet to take such an initiative. “But our health inspectors continue to make routine inspections to ensure the prescribed standards,” she said. Creating awareness Responding to food safety concerns, G. Jayapal, General Secretary of Kerala Hotel and Restaurant Association, said the FSSAI had given its nod for the use of permitted colours in food items at prescribed limits. “However, we have requested our members not to use synthetic colours or additives. It’s a misconception that use of such materials will enhance the taste of dishes served to customers. The lack of skilled workers may often result in the use of colours. We have now launched a major programme to create awareness and educate stakeholders,” he said. Mr. Jayapal said the association had launched a training programme for workers employed in hotels and restaurants across the State. “Each class will have 40 persons. Experts will train them on how to abide by the rules and regulations prescribed by the FSSAI. A certificate will be issued to each participant after successful completion of the programme, which will also test their knowledge levels on various aspects related to food safety,” he said. Misbranding Food safety officials pointed out that misbranding of food items remained another major concern. Inspections found that such products lacked details regarding ingredients, batch number, lot number, date of manufacturing and date of expiry. Complaints about misbranding were found mainly in packets of toor dal, drinking water, cake, rusk, double-toned milk, cashew nut, blended vegetable oil, etc. As per the FSSAI, anyone who either by themselves or through any other person on their behalf manufactures for sale, store or sells or distributes or imports any food article for human consumption, which is misbranded, will be liable to a penalty of up to ₹3 lakh. The adjudicating officer is eligible to issue a direction to a person found guilty of an offence under this section for taking corrective action to rectify mistakes or such articles of food would be destroyed. If a person or a company is selling food articles of substandard quality, the food business operator may be charged an amount up to ₹5 lakh."

FDCA Commissioner Hemant Koshiya divulges more details about the initiative in his talk with Sohini Ghosh. How was the idea of opening up kitchens to customers conceived? A lot of our department’s work involves fieldwork and it was during one such visit that I stopped to have snacks at a highway restaurant. While the outside ambience was clean and overall great, I was curious about the kitchen conditions. They did not know who I was and I did not tell them. I saw that the kitchen entry had a ‘no admission’ board. When I saw the kitchen, it was very dirty and unhygienic, so much so that I thought I cannot eat there. I came back to my office and then decided that I want to act on such entry restrictions come (lunar) New Year (post-Diwali). So we thought that doors can be replaced by glass panels or where the same may not be possible, a glass window be fixed that allows one to see the kitchen and its conditions without risking contamination. Story continues below this ad There are food safety officers, then why was the need felt to open up kitchens? At present, the state has more than 5,000 registered hotels and restaurants, especially in the densely populated eight municipal corporations, some along the highways and a few in the smaller towns. I have 250 food safety officers. So it is not possible with the handful of staff to monitor the day-to-day activities of all the restaurants. How did you go about implementing it? I issued an internal circular to all my 43 Designated Officers (DO), who are the district-level licensing authorities for food under the Food Safety Act, across the state. The circular stated that in all restaurants/hotels in your jurisdiction kitchen doors need to be removed and that there should be a glass panel/glass window so that operations within the kitchen can be seen. Story continues below this ad Simultaneously, the next day, I also wrote to the president of the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Gujarat, asking them to circulate our move widely among their fraternity for greater compliance. While the circular was not legally binding, it became ethically binding. It is a win-win situation because there were already hotels and restaurants with open kitchen concepts and customers can make an informed choice. Secondly, those who maintain standards and are law-abiding should not have a problem to willingly showcase the standards maintained in their kitchen. It will only increase their business. Thirdly, it also decreases the workload on us, the government. If not complying with the hygiene standards, under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, Section 56 (the penalty for unhygienic or unsanitary processing or manufacturing of food), they can be fined up to one lakh rupees. On November 8, we told all our DO that whichever food safety officers are under you, tell them to survey five restaurants/hotels in their jurisdiction to gauge compliance, minus any coercive action. Till now, we have not had any complaints What has been the outcome so far? As of Tuesday, we have surveyed more than 3,000 hotels/restaurants across the state. Nearly 75% hoteliers have proactively removed any such signs restricting entry; 60% already had a glass window or panel prior to the notification. Those not compliant, have been educated and made aware and we are expecting full compliance within a week. Surat has seen the highest compliance with up to 500 restaurants/hotels now allowing entry into their kitchens. Their model of forming a team dedicated to this has shown encouraging results and the best practice can be replicated all over the state. Story continues below this ad I met CEO of Food Safety and Standards Authority of India Pawan Kumar Agarwal and its chairperson, Rita Teaotia, on November 13 appreciated this move and I was told that three to four states have called Agarwal, requesting him to implement this pan-India. Were there any initial inhibitions? Surprisingly, we have not faced any opposition to this move. Hoteliers had some reservation initially, thinking that customers can access any area which may lead to contamination of food. I clarified that our intention was to allow for see-through accessibility. Once the air was cleared on that, everyone has welcomed the move. I believe that also has to do with the fact that the restaurants realise that opposing this may send out a wrong message (for their own business)."

A team led by R. Kathiravan, Designated Officer, Food Safety, conducted the sudden inspections at a jaggery auction centre near Shevapet. Dr. Kathiravan, along with seven Food Safety officials checked jaggery balls brought in 42 trucks to the centre. A total of 41.7 tonnes of jaggery was seized, and 23 samples lifted. The jaggery had been brought in from various parts of Salem. Dr. Kathiravan said the raids were conducted based on adulteration complaints sent to both the Food Safety Department and the Chief Minister Special Cell. “About 80 tonnes were brought for auction here and about 41 tonnes have been seized. We have lifted 23 samples to check for adulteration. These samples will be sent to the Food Samples Laboratory, Guindy in Chennai, for a detailed analysis."" Dr. Kathiravan said a combination of substances could have been added to the jaggery, one of them being a substance called sodium hydrosulfite. This is a permitted bleaching agent but its residual value should be only 50 ppm. The seized goods could have residual values of this agent beyond permissible limits, officials said. Officials also said that super phosphate, a fertiliser is also being used as a binding agent. Dr. Kathiravan said that further action would be taken based on test results."

Adulterated milk products, processed with concentrated chemicals and synthetic flavours, can lead to protracted health problems such as ulcer. The problem warrants special attention of authorities. A law that empowers both the police and health departments to raid and arrest those involved in adulteration of food products could nip the problem in the bud. While food safety is the responsibility of the health department, officials seem to have ‘outsourced’ the task to police. Over the past two months, the cops have busted six major gangs involved in adulteration. They, however, rue the fact that their role is limited due to legal hurdles and lack of testing kits. The department will be able to function better if they are empowered to file cases under the Prevention of Food Adulteration (PFA) Act like the food safety department. A centralised database of habitual offenders, shared across the state, can also help in curbing the crime. JAIPUR: More than of half of milks products supplied in the city are estimated to be spurious. Jaipur police in last two months have seized large quantities of synthetic ghee , fake paneer and adulterated milk cakes processed with concentrated chemicals often used in making detergent powders.The initial investigation indicates that a large bulk of adulterated products was to be supplied to sweet shops and traders for weddings and festivals.“Adulterated milk products are non-perishable. Therefore, unlike genuine products, they can be used for a prolonged period of time and need not to be stored in freezers,” said SP (Jaipur rural) Shankar Dutt Sharma.One of the reasons pointed out by the police behind the illicit trade is that per person consumption of milk products has shot up in the city. The production, however, has not been able to match up the demand. The gap is adequately fulfilled by gangs. So much so that over the span of last decade, adulterated milk production has grwon into a multi-crore organised criminal enterprise.“A trader who buys an adulterated milk product for Rs 100 per kg sells it to suppliers for Rs 350 per kg. With a profit margin of Rs 250 kg on each sale, the accused reaps regular windfalls. They hardly have any concern for people who consume these toxic products,” Sharma told TOI, adding that over 50 per cent of milk products currently used in the city could be adulterated.On November 20, the police seized 2,000 kg of fake paneer from two pick-up trucks near Chandwaji on Jaipur-Delhi national highway. The subsequent investigation revealed that ‘dangerous’ paneer was to be supplied to two major distributers in the city for weddings. “An estimated two lakh people would have consumed that paneer at weddings and other functions, leading to dangerous health cases like ulcer, increased heart palpations etc,” Sharma said.After the crackdown on fake paneer, several shops in the city reported an acute shortage of the milk product. “Besides fake paneer and milk cakes, we also unearthed a unit where adulterated ghee was packaged in saras packets and sold in the market,” he added."

Officials said that there were two categories — licensing for FBOs with an annual turnover of above ₹12 lakh and registration for FBOs, whose annual turnover does not exceed ₹ 12 lakh — under the Food Safety and Standards Act 2006. Now, the State government is implementing Section 69 of the Act, conferring powers on the Commissioner of Food Safety and Drug Administration to empower the DOs to compound offences committed or any contravention of the provision of the Act for effective implementation of the Act. Types of FBOs The types of FBOs are petty manufacturers, petty retailers, hawkers, itinerant vendor or temporary stall holder in social gatherings, milk FBO handling up to 500 litres per day, FBOs with slaughtering capacity of two large animals or 10 small animals or 50 poultry birds a day, all FBOs eligible for registration, but running business without registration certificate, all FBOs found selling banned food items and seized banned food items less than the sample quantity in their premises and FBOs selling or using non-food grade plastic or plastics not permitted by the Act for food packing or serving, a press release said. For instance, if a food business is operating without registration or has improper labelling and substandard food quality, DOs would immediately issue notice and grant one week to 10 days time for rectification. If not, a spot fine would be levied, and the FBO has to pay it in the treasury, an official also said. No penalty would be collected in cash at the office of the DO. If the FBO does not pay the penalty within the stipulated time, the DO can suspend the registration certificate until payment of the penalty. The highest amount of ₹25,000 would be the penalty for third time offence for FBOs found selling/possessing of banned food items."
thehindu.com,cities,How safe is the fish?,05-12-2019,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/how-safe-is-the-fish/article30173880.ece,"The recent seizure of over 660 kg of formalin-laced fish from various markets in the city has brought fish trade and food safety enforcement under intense scrutiny. The crackdown on adulterated and stale fish by the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation has sparked renewed concerns about the quality of fish that find their way to markets and households. The civic body’s health wing had confiscated 1,122 kg of stale fish and 663 kg of contaminated fish during its drive. A major portion of the adulterated fish was seized from the markets in Kazhakuttam and Sreekaryam. Complaints galore “We have been receiving numerous complaints regarding expensive varieties of fish being laced with chemical preservatives. The drive was undertaken soon after we obtained sufficient stock of the rapid detection kits developed by the Central Institute of Fisheries Technology (CIFT),” S.S. Minu, Health Inspector of the City Corporation, said. Food safety officers are yet to record any case of fish adulteration in the district this year. While two cases of chemical-laced fish were detected here from 2016-2018, there have been none this year, despite 62 inspections being conducted by the Commissionerate of Food Safety in the district. Expressing doubts on the findings of the Corporation, food safety officers questioned the manner in which adulteration of fish stocks was confirmed. They said the findings of the examination using the rapid detection kits could not be considered conclusive. The presence of chemical substances can be confirmed only through a detailed examination in the Government Analyst’s Laboratory. Noneth eless, the Commissionerate has maintained heightened surveillance at the State borders and major markets within as part of the Operation Sagar Rani, ever since nearly 22 tonnes of formalin-laced fish were seized from Amaravila, Aryankavu, and Walayar a year ago. The government has intensified vigilance, anticipating attempts to smuggle fish preserved in ammonia and formalin (or formaldehyde), a carcinogen, from Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. According to Alex K. Isaac, Assistant Food Safety Commissioner, Thiruvananthapuram, their multi-pronged enforcement strategy involves maintaining a close watch over fish consignments that pass through the borders in Amaravila and Poovar and collecting samples from gathering points including Edappazhanji where the fish stock is initially brought before being taken out to various parts of the city. While these loads are inspected as early as 2 a.m., food safety officers also collect more samples from markets before the fish is kept for sale. Besides the joint inspection squads comprising officials of the Health and Fisheries Departments, the Commissionerate also regularly deploys its Quick Response Team to attend to exigencies such as suspected cases of food poisoning reported from across the district. “We have also focussed on imparting awareness among fish vendors. They have been advised to maintain their fish supply through trusted dealers and to reject loads suspected to contain stale fish. Over 70% of the fish vendors in the district have food safety registration that enables the department to keep a close watch on the fish sales,” Mr. Isaac said. Negligence Despite the precautionary measures, complaints continue to come in thick and fast from the public. While in most cases the complainants claim to have been duped into buying rotten fish, food safety officers blame many instances on the negligent handling of the perishable after purchase. According to Pooja Ravindran, the district nodal officer for food safety, consumers often tend to overlook the shelf life of fresh fish and leave them in room temperature for long periods. “While many people prefer to purchase large quantities of fish and stock them in freezer, we will not recommend the consumption of the sea food beyond two days after their catch,” the officer said. She added that the success of the enforcement activities hinged on awareness among the consumers and the trading community. The Commissionerate has tapped various means including the social media to sensitise the public. A toll-free number (1800 425 1125) is in service as part of its campaign to ensure food safety. Classes are also being planned for fish workers, vendors and other stakeholders early next year."

Some of the aspects of the checklist include keeping poultry and mutton shops away from contaminated areas, the place must be well-lit, adequate space for slaughter, dressing of poultry and the chopping block must be of food grade synthetic material among others. Before beginning the audit in December, it was decided in a meeting held on Friday that FSSAI officials would meet manufacturers and sellers of the above shops to help them improve their quality and hygiene as per the guidelines. “After briefing the shops and speaking to stakeholders, an external agency has been appointed to audit 27 slaughterhouses across Karnataka, which have central and state licences. Those slaughterhouses which come under a municipality or are run by private entities, without licence, will be audited by DOs. Altogether 50 sweet and 50 meat shops will be audited in Bengaluru by another external agency, and 10 in the district and two in the taluks by DOs and FSOs,” said N Manjushree, commissioner, FSSAI, Karnataka. “Hygiene ratings will be given as an outcome of the audit which will give an idea to the consumers about what they are consuming from these shops. These can be displayed in front of the shop. A report will be submitted to the state by March on slaughterhouses and by February for sweet and meat shops. The reports will be made public as well,” she added. Transportation is also a part of the checklist wherein the animals to be slaughtered must be transported at an appropriate temperature, without overcrowding and they must given food and water, without cruelty or contamination. The workers’ personal hygiene, hand-washing units, pest control and putting traps or screens in gutter or drainage will also have to be checked. Inspecting the animals’ health before slaughter and checking for tetanus and rabies is part of the list for large animals. Most of the slaughter houses are in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts, with a few in Bengaluru and surrounding areas."

As per a new directive, Designated Officers of the FSSAI in each district can now impose spot fine on FBOs who are found with certain visible violations. While violation for the first and second time attracts fine, repetition of the same violation for a third time will attract a higher amount of fine and cancellation of the registration certificate issued by the food regulator. The spot fine is also expected to have an impact on the sale of banned products like gutka as seizure of any such item for a third time will attract cancellation of registration certificate and a spot fine of ₹ 25,000, the highest fine among all violations. K. Tamilselvan, Designated Officer of FSSAI for Coimbatore, said that the spot fine system was expected to have a deterrent effect on FBOs that repeatedly flouted food safety norms. “The new directive empowers Designated Officers to levy spot fine when a food is found containing extraneous matter, FBOs failing to comply with directions of food safety officers, unhygienic or unsanitary processing or manufacturing and sale of food items,” he said. FBOs, who are slapped with a spot fine, will have to pay the amount at the treasury and food safety officers cannot collect the penalty as cash. If the FBOs fail to pay the penalty within the stipulated time, the Designated Officer can suspend the registration certificate of the FBO until the penalty is paid. According to Dr. Tamilselvan, misbranding, label violations, possession of banned food products and adulteration in certain food items are among the common visible violations found in Coimbatore. “The spot fine applies to the possession of banned food item like gutka when the seized quantity is less than that of the sample quantity. Sample quantity means the quantity required to lift four separate samples of the same item for laboratory analysis. Now, even if a vendor is found with two or three sachets of different gutka, spot fine can be levied,” he explained.

Sarathi said that the food safety officers should also strictly implement other provisions of the FSSAI Act to bring down other violations by FBOs. Citing an incident wherein he found worm in a packaged drinking water a year ago, sample of which was subsequently found “unfit for human consumption” in a laboratory analysis, Mr. Sarathi said that the food regulator only served a ‘caution notice’ to the manufacturer. “Such offences should have seen a logical end of prosecution by the court and heavy fine should have been imposed on the violator,” he opined. A meat stall owner with whom The Hindu spoke to said that the spot fine would not affect traders, who sold quality meat to customers, but would help buyers understand those who sold sub-standard items."
thehindu.com,cities,Shortfall in sugarcane hits jaggery production in Erode district,12-12-2019,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/shortfall-in-sugarcane-hits-jaggery-production-in-erode-district/article30280417.ece,"With one month left for Pongal festival, production of jaggery is on as usual at the small units spread over the district even as manufacturers say that shortfall in sugarcane production is affecting their business. There are over 220 units in Mullamparappu, Arachalur, Perundurai, Kavindapadi and Ammapet areas in the district where production of jaggery and brown sugar is carried out for many generations. These small units, depending upon the production capacity, employ less than 20 persons who, except for the month-long holiday in January, work throughout the year producing jaggery and brown sugar. Sugarcane juice is extracted, boiled and stirred continuously, filtered and moulded manually and packed in gunny bags, each weighing 30 kg and is known as “sippam”. Orders were placed by the traders and the final product is taken to the jaggery market at Chithode for auctioning. K. Rajamaniyan (67), who runs a unit in Mullamparappu for 41 years, said that sugarcane was easily available in local areas until 2015 and they were getting reasonable price for their produce. “In the past four years, we have to purchase it from Bhavani and transportation cost takes away our profit”, he said. By crushing one tonne of cane, they were able to get 80 kg of jaggery which was 100 kg earlier. “About 20 years ago, we were getting up to 120 kg of jaggery”, he said and added that the quality of the cane had also dropped over the years. He said that there is no much joy for them for Pongal as the orders are normal and the price of jaggery varies from ₹40 to ₹45 a kg. Jaggery produced here is sold at Srivilliputhur, Rajapalayam, Madurai, Kovilpatti, and Thoothukudi and also in Kerala for making tea. Banned chemicals are used by the manufactures to remove impurities from the jaggery while boiling and many units continue with the practice. Speaking on anonymity, another owner said that since traders insist on the product to be bright yellow in colour, they were adding more chemicals. “We will not get the right price, if chemicals are not added”, he said and added that jaggery made of natural colours were purchased at low price. Since jaggery has immense health benefits, owners wanted the government to promote it and also help in export so that the cottage industry survives. Officials of the Tamil Nadu Food Safety Department had on December 7 raided the jaggery market at Chithode and seized 2,910 kg of adulterated product. Officials wanted consumers to insist on natural colours instead of the adulterated bright yellow coloured jaggery."

The agency, which conducted a surprise inspection of Food Safety offices in the State, said that inspectors accepted bribes and rarely sent food samples collected from outlets for chemical examination. They appeared reluctant to register complaints from the public or record them in registers and give acknowledgement receipts to petitioners. Citizens who sought information on action taken on their appeals were turned away harshly. Director General, VACB, Anil Kanth had ordered the inspections code-named Operation Jeevan after a family was laid low recently consuming stale food from a popular latenight eatery here. Investigators said that Food Safety inspectors routinely buried damning food safety analysis reports to save favoured hoteliers in exchange of sizeable backhander payments. In many cases, food safety officials did little to remove banned food products from supermarket shelves. The agency said corrupt officials ensured that food safety violation never reached the trial stage. They saved the accused by letting them off with minor fines. Records fudged Food safety officials who detected persons responsible for food contamination rarely prosecuted them. They fudged records and accepted bribes to protect the offenders. In many cases, officials laid down a smokescreen by conducting make-believe inspections at predictable places and timings. They often saved violators by insulating them from criminal prosecution and restored the food permits secretly days after they annulled them publicly. In Varkala, the VACB found that inspectors had only sent eight out of the 101 stale food samples seized from various outlets for food safety tests. The office had taken no action on 23 complaints received from tourists about food sold in the tourist resort area. In Thiruvananthapuram, the VACB found that the Assistant Commissioner, Food Safety, had taken no action on 78 complaints. The situation was the same in food safety offices in other districts. An investigator said hoteliers paid food safety inspectors to inform them earlier about food safety raids."

The Corporation’s eagle eye special squad had seized nearly 2.5 tonnes of Threadfin bream (Kilimeen) from Pattom around 3 a.m on Thursday, while the fish-laden truck was on its way to the Pangode fish market. The health officials detected the presence of formalin using rapid detection kits developed by the Central Institute of Fisheries Technology. The agents were slapped with a fine of ₹25,000. But, late on Thursday evening, the result from the Food Safety Department indicated that the test for formalin was negative. Corporation Mayor K.Sreekumar has now questioned this test result, accusing some officials of the Food Safety Department of having an unholy nexus with the lobby transporting formalin-laced fish to Kerala. In a statement issued here on Friday, he said that the two people who accompanied the vehicle were convinced by the Corporation’s test result. They also paid the fine without any complaints, after realising their mistake. The Corporation had called in the Food Safety Department officials to carry out confirmatory tests in the laboratory. “However, they did not even follow the guidelines in the collection of samples by taking it without labels in a plastic carrybag. Though the Corporation had asked for detailed tests using the HPLC method and the GC-MS method, the Food Safety Department also carried out a mere rapid formalin test. The team which had developed the kit had made it clear that the test will not provide the right results if the samples are collected and the rapid test done some hours later. If the department was planning only this rapid test, they could have done it in front of the public at the Corporation office. The whole act of taking it to the laboratory and carrying out a rapid test is suspect,” he said. Three samples taken When contacted, Alex Isaac, the Assistant Commissioner, FSD, said that all the tests are carried out by qualified professionals only. “As per the Corporation's request, we had taken three samples and this was the result that the Government Analyst's Laboratory got. The delay in the other samples could be because different tests take different amounts of time. Some can be completed in as less as one hour, while some others take around 15 days,” he said."

A division bench of Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy passed this direction, while hearing a PIL plea on usage of carbide for artificial ripening of fruits. A news report on how carbide was being used for artificially ripening fruits in a Telugu daily and how health of people was being adversely affected by this had been taken up as PIL by the HC in 2015. After hearing contentions of counsel, the bench instructed the Principal Secretary of Medical and Health to ascertain how many Food Safety Officers were required to keep tabs on different types of food contamination and initiate legal action against the offenders. While assessing the required number of posts, the government should not go by how many such posts were created in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Karnataka, the bench said in its interim direction. But the government should take into account the population of the State and assess the number of Food Safety Officer posts required to look after the health of people, the bench said in its order. It also instructed the Telangana State Public Service Commission (TSPSC) to fill 36 posts of Food Safety Inspector/Food Safety Officer lying vacant out of the 61 posts created by the government. Posts of six Gazetted Food Inspector and one post of Assistant Food Controller, along with the above posts, should be filled within two months, said the order. The bench ordered the government to file an affidavit on the measures it had taken to curtail production of carbide and how it was controlling availability of carbide in the market. It sought to know how many persons the government had prosecuted for misuse of carbide till the end of November 2019. The plea was posted for January 6, 2020."

Though the results are overall satisfactory, given the wide use of milk, particularly for infants and children, a higher pass percentage would instil more confidence in the public.Emphasising that issues of contamination are bigger than adulteration in milk, the regulator said the presence of Aflatoxin-M1 in samples of processed milk sold by organised players is a serious concern.Non-compliance with presence of Aflatoxin M1, antibiotics and pesticides were higher in samples of processed milk as compared to raw milk. Aflatoxin-M1 is the result of poor storage practices of animal feed and fodder. Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Kerala were the top three states with highest levels of Aflatoxin M1 residues. Madhya Pradesh topped the list for antibiotics.""Presence of of Aflatoxin M1 in processed milk sold by organised players is a key concern. This is a wake up call for dairies. To address these issues, we are instituting a scheme for testing and sampling for organised dairy. It will be implemented from January 1, 2020,"" FSSAI chief executive Pawan Agarwal said.Of the total non-compliant samples, 37.7% were of processed milk whereas 47% were raw products.The adulteration was mainly on account of low fat or low SNF (solid non fat) or both. The regulator said non-compliance on these parameters in raw milk could be because of species, quality of feed and fodder or due to dilution of milk with water. Non-compliance of fat and SNF in standardised or processed milk is however surprising.The survey - the first comprehensive one - was conducted by a third party between May, 2018 to October 2018 covering all states and UTs. It entailed both organised (retailers and processors) as well as non-organised (local dairy farms, milk vendors and milk mandis) sectors. Number of samples collected was linked to population and covered different types of milk (raw and processed of various types)."

As per the rituals of “Niladri Bije”, the rasagola bhoga is traditionally offered to Devi Lakshmi on behalf of Shree Jagannath. As per the Record of Rights, this is the duty of Bhitarachha Sebaka, it said.“Odisha rasagola is a sweet from the state of Odisha, made with chhena cooked in sugar syrup, which is very soft to feel, juicy and non‐chewy in consistency and can be swallowed without teeth pressure. Colour development of Odisha rasagola is very specific, where without addition of external colour, various intensity-coloured rasagolas are prepared using the principle of caramalisation of sugar with specific methods of preparation. Generally, the Odisha rasagola is white in colour with round shape (non‐ spherical) but off white rasagolas in various shades are prepared by cooking rasagola at 110 degrees C for about 40 minutes in which caramalisation of sugar takes place giving the off white colour,” said the report.Moments after West Bengal chief minister announced the GI tag for rasgulla in 2017, a social and political outcry was triggered in Odisha, which had a rich legacy of rasagola. Following opinions from jurists and patent experts, including Chennai-based attorney P Sanjay Gandhi, the present application was filed, culminating into an Odisha Rasagola now. “It is a proud moment for everyone involved in the exercise,” Sanjay Gandhi told TOI.As for Odisha rasagola’s uniqueness, the report said the sweet is famous for its distinct quality, features and characteristics. The impact of evolutionary process and technology infusion over hundreds of years has led to developing a unique rasagola called Odisha rasagola, which has been influenced by its geography and cultural anthropogeny to a great extent in developing this unique product,” it said.The reference of rasagola is found in the late 15th century Odia Ramayana written by Balaram Das. Das’s Ramayana is known as Dandi Ramayana or Jagamohana Ramayana as it was composed and sung at the Jagamohana of the Puri Temple.In its 'Ajodhya Kanda', one comes across elaborate descriptions of chhena and chhena‐based products including rasagola. According to the description, after Lord Rama left for the forest, Bharata and Satrughna went to bring him back and on their way, accepted the hospitality of sage Bharadwaj. The sage served them and their followers various types of food and delicacies which included dudha chhena (cottage cheese prepared from milk) and the products from chhena namely chhenapuri, chhenaladu, rasagola and rasabali.As for the general sanitation practices adopted by producers of Odisha rasagola, the report said it is mandatory on the part of the producers of Odisha rasagola to keep the production unit neat and clean. They have to sanitise it at regular interval following standard operating procedure as per provisions of the Food Safety Act, 2006 and 2011.All the utensils have to be cleaned thoroughly using approved sterilisers. All persons engaged in production process will ensure use of approved head cover, nose and mouth mask, hand gloves and shoes (to be used only in production unit) at the Odisha rasagola production unit or workshop to prevent any type of contamination.They are not permitted to wear jewellery during production and handling. All inputs are to be stored in a neat and clean environment so as to ensure protection against contamination from insects, pests and pathogenic microbes. Similar procedure is also followed for post‐ production and storage handling of Odisha rasagola."

The IT ministry recently instructed Google and Facebook to take down 'false and malicious' videos and content that spread misinformation regarding safety and quality of food in India.Ministry argued that the 'fake' information spread by miscreants misusing social media is eroding the public's confidence in institutions tasked with food safety The ministry specifically mentioned instances like creating false scare of plastic eggs, plastic rice, melamine in milk etc. to drive home their demand to tech giants.Here are 5 instances (apart from those stated by IT ministry) when panic and fear was spread through hoax warnings:In 2013, a message purporting to be from Delhi Police, was circulated on social media warning people not to drink any product from Frooti since a worker has added HIV-contaminated blood to the drinks.The message read “Important msg from Delhi police to all over India: For the next few weeks, do not drink any product of Frooti, as a worker from the company has added his blood contaminated with AIDS (Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome)...Please forward this message urgently to people you care, share it as much as u can (sic).""The message turned out to be a hoax . It was neither from Delhi Police nor were the claims made true.In a statement issued by Parle Agro, the company that manufactures and distributes Frooti in India, it had debunked the fake message and assured consumers that Frooti products are safe.The statement as posted by the company on its Facebook page can be read here A malicious video was circulated in 2018 and the claim was that Aashirvaad Atta contains plastic.The claim turned out to be false.Consumer goods giant ITC, the company that manufactures ‘Aashirvaad Atta’, called it a mischievous attempt to destroy consumers’ trust in them.“What is being called plastic is in fact Wheat Protein or Gluten, found naturally in all atta. This wheat protein is also known as gluten which binds the atta together and gives elasticity to the dough when kneaded. Please also be informed that, even as per FSSAI regulations under the Food Safety and Standards Act 2006, all atta must contain a minimum of 6% gluten on a dry wheat basis. Read FSSAI's statement on Gluten in Atta” read a statement issued by ITC.Besides filing FIR against those who shared videos falsely accusing it of using plastics, the company even released a video commercial to bust bogus claims.People in parts of Karnataka were alarmed when news reports in 2017 said that plastic sugar was sold in stores.Even news agency ANI reported about it.Sensible consumers wondered why anyone would produce plastic sugar because the cost of production of plastic sugar could be even higher.In January last year, government allayed the fears around this saying that no specific case of presence of plastic sugar was detected/reported from anywhere in the country.The same was established during random sampling and testing of sugar done by the officials of Food Safety Departments of respective States/UTs to check compliance of the standards laid down under the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006, Rules and Regulations.A video claiming to show how a ‘plastic cabbage ’ peel does not easily catch fire when placed over an open gas flame led rise to rumours of ‘plastic cabbages’ from China making their way to India.While many such videos were actually about wax-food replicas, videos in which real cabbages were used, it took a long time to burn as their leaves are thick and contain a lot of moisture.Videos claiming Pepsico's Kurkure corn puffs -- developed and sold in India -- containing plastic started doing the rounds on social media last year.Calling the whole phenomenon "" fake news ,"" Pepsico India successfully sued to get a court order against Facebook, requiring the company to censor any posts linking Kurkure and plastic, including jokes / criticism of Pepsico products."
thehindu.com,cities,Tobacco products seized,24-03-2019,https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Coimbatore/tobacco-products-seized/article26622188.ece,"Officials from Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), Coimbatore have seized banned tobacco products weighing nearly 120 kg from a private bus here on Friday. B Vijayalalithambigai, Designated Officer, FSSAI, Coimbatore led the team of five food safety officers, who conducted the raid in the bus at around 3 a.m. The bus, which was reportedly plying between Bengaluru and Coimbatore, was confiscated by the officials after seizing the banned items. Food safety officials said that they have been investigating for the last few days whether such banned tobacco items were being transported into Tamil Nadu from other States through buses. They added that the same bus was caught last December when it was carrying gutka . The district administration will confiscate any vehicle that sells, possesses, transport or manufacture banned tobacco products, the food safety officials said. The Tamil Nadu government banned the manufacture, storage and sale of the chewable forms of tobacco such as gutka and pan masala in 2013."

During such raids on the dairy plants in the past couple of months, it has been discovered that milk containing detergent, urea and starch was being manufactured and supplied in the market."
indiatimes.com,city,Choking on tobacco: Alarming increase in the inflow of banned tobacco products in Ernakulam,11-07-2019,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kochi/choking-on-tobacco/articleshow/70165279.cms,"KOCHI: The alarming increase in the inflow of banned tobacco products like gutkha, pan masala and other variants containing tobacco and nicotine from other states to Ernakulam district is proving a major bugbear for excise officers.Adding to their misery is the fact that there is no facility to destroy the seized tobacco products. They are forced to either burn or bury it and experts say both the methods are harmful to the environment and can contribute towards health conditions.In 2019, till May-end, Ernakulam excise division seized 7,430.73kg and 13,480 packets of smokeless tobacco products compared to a total of 4,342.57kg and 5,460 packets in 2018.The number of Copta (Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act 2003) cases registered in the same period were 4,074 and 4,080, respectively.The challenge to dispose of the tonnes of tobacco products seized every month, is so huge that in some of the offices, products confiscated three years ago are yet to be destroyed.Though the excise is entrusted with the responsibility of assisting health and food safety departments in implementing the ban of these tobacco products, there are no guidelines on how to dispose of seized goods. In the absence of guidelines, officials set their own rules. While some bury them in pits, others burn them as they say that there is not enough land in range offices to dig pits. Some even dump them in water bodies in small quantities, which has its own environmental and health effects. The heaps of seized contraband have taken up most of the space in several range offices and the stink is unbearable. The end result? Officers are forced to reduce the frequency of raids.“Seizure is easier than disposal. Many offices are loaded with huge heaps of tobacco products which raise a stink. Officers have no clue on how to get rid of them. Many of our officers, who dispose them of manually, say they have breathing problems and irritation on skin. Though the issue has been raised before higher authorities, the call for a proper mechanism for disposal remains unaddressed,” said a senior excise official.In the case of seized illicit spirit and synthetic drugs, they can be sold to pharmaceuticals and chemical companies as they have other uses. But tobacco products do not have any other use. Though the officers explored the possibility of using tobacco as a natural pesticide (pukayila kashayam), the content of chemicals in the products is a problem.“Earlier, it was easier to get rid of them as only small quantities were seized. They were burnt at the corporation’s incinerators. But now, local authorities are unwilling to take them as residents raise concern about health issues. Burying them after opening every packet is impractical as there are tens of thousands of such packets,” said an officer.The threat posed by plastic packets of tobacco is another problem as it cannot be buried due to environmental impacts. “Though tobacco is buried, the plastic packets continue to be heaped on the premises of offices. Now, officers are forced to throw these packets at ‘puramboke land’ at nights,” said a range officer.Meanwhile, assistant excise commissioner T A Ashok Kumar said the issue has been raised at the excise commissioner’s conference and the remaining tobacco products will be destroyed and buried at excise’s unused land in Mamala."
thehindu.com,other,Big boost to aquaculture,13-03-2019,https://frontline.thehindu.com/other/advertorial/article26481465.ece,"K.S. SRINIVAS, Chairman of The Marine Products Export Development Authority (MPEDA), in an interview to Frontline , spoke at length about the state of the seafood industry and how the MPEDA works with various stakeholders to bolster exports and earn valuable foreign exchange for India. Excerpts: Seafood exports are driven by the private sector. What is the MPEDA’s role in this? The MPEDA is the nodal agency for the promotion of Indian seafood export. Its role is to create a congenial environment for the smooth export of fish and fishery products thereby paving the way for the growth of seafood exports. It identifies bottlenecks in seafood trade at each stage and takes corrective action. Broadly, it registers seafood processing units, fishing vessels, pre-processing centres, exporters, cold/other storages and chilled/live and dried fish handling centres, interacts with stakeholders, government departments, overseas importing authorities and associations. We initiate marketing activities such as buyer-seller meets, delegation visits to potential markets, participation in international seafood fairs, organising international seafood fairs in India and branding and advertisement for Indian seafood in various media platforms. Other functions include extension through societies such as the National Centre for Sustainable Aquaculture [NaCSA] among aqua farmers and Network for Fish Quality Management and Sustainable Fishing [NETFISH] among fishers and fish processing workers, and research and development for commercial aquaculture activities through the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Aquaculture [RGCA]. Given the focus on sustainability the world over, how does the MPEDA propose to increase exports in line with the Union Agriculture Ministry’s 2020 vision, and, at the same time, keep in mind the need to remain sustainable? India is the second largest fish producer in the world. The Indian marine fishing sector produced 3.83 million tonnes in 2017 with a potential of 4.40 million tonnes. Lack of adequate infrastructure facilities in fishing harbours and landing centres leads to post-harvest losses and reduction in the quality of fish landed, which in turn reduces the cost realisation. The MPEDA plays an active role in addressing the issue in order to upgrade the fishing harbours and landing centres to international standards, which in turn would facilitate better quality and pricing. As the catch from the fishing sector is more or less stagnating, aquaculture has been identified as the only alternative for generating additional raw material to augment seafood exports. Therefore, the Government of India has accorded a major thrust to it under the Blue Revolution scheme. Value addition of seafood is another thrust area to increase India’s export with sustainable utilisation of the existing resources. Though countries such as Vietnam, China, and Thailand are making big strides in export of marine products through value addition of their own raw material and also through reprocessing of the imported raw material, the share of value-added products in volume in India’s exports is just 5 per cent as against 64 per cent of Thailand, 35 per cent of China and 26 per cent of Vietnam. Many of our units still depend on wild caught material, which is seasonal in nature, and hence the average utilisation of processing capacity is only 25-30 per cent. A solution to this is to import raw material for value addition and re-export. This will enhance employment generation, improve profit margins and help exploit resources judiciously. The policy envisages higher investment in value addition, interventions to ease norms for import of raw materials and better incentives for value-added products. The MPEDA plays a pivotal role in capacity building on value addition and product development with overseas expertise. It also offers financial assistance schemes on infrastructure development for value addition and also for gaining international certifications for the value chains so that such accomplishments can be used as market access and promotional tools. The MPEDA directly, and through NETFISH, plays a major role in sustaining resources and achieving coastal conservation through capacity-building measures and by urging policy interventions and implementation of regulations by the fisheries and wildlife departments. Planned development of aquaculture is one of the key steps for ensuring sustainability. With this objective in mind, the MPEDA has approached all the coastal States by preparing action plans for the development of export infrastructure, including the primary production infrastructure for diversified aquaculture. Traceability labelling of catch is becoming a “must” in some regions, particularly Europe. So are the regulations to eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. What steps has the MPEDA taken to surmount these issues given India’s poor record in maintaining traceability? The government is in the process of developing and having in place a robust traceability system for aquaculture produce right from the farms to processing plants through the chain of custody. The MPEDA has taken initiatives to prepare guidelines for the certification of farms and hatcheries, which will help in ensuring the traceability of produce. It is the nodal agency to validate the catch certification system under the European Union regulation 1005/2008 on IUU fishing and also for the ICCAT [International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas] system of catch reporting, which requires traceability up to the boat level. It also validates the DS 2031 certificate, required for exporting shrimps to the U.S. market, that the shrimps are harvested in a manner not harmful to sea turtles. There have been instances of Indian seafood consignments being rejected in Europe and elsewhere. What role does the MPEDA play in ensuring that the products are accepted in these destination countries? All the major importing countries such as the E.U. [27 member states], the U.S., and Japan test Indian seafood products at border inspection posts [BIP] for various parameters, including antibiotic residues, cadmium and microorganisms. On the basis of the test results, if there is a contamination, the consignment is rejected. Since October 2016, the E.U. has increased the sampling of Indian shrimp consignments to 50 per cent from 10 per cent, which may also be the reason for an increased number of detections. What has been the role of the RGCA in achieving self-sufficiency in seeds? The RGCA, which was established in 1995, acts as an aquaculture technology incubation centre for the MPEDA by producing seeds of commercial aquatic species meant exclusively for export. What are the achievements of NETFISH? NETFISH was formed as a society under the aegis of the MPEDA to impart training to fishermen on marine conservation, post-harvest handling and other techniques. It was formulated to concentrate on capacity building in fish quality management and conservation of marine fishery resources at the grass-roots level by networking with fishermen societies, federations and other non-governmental organisations. Thus, NETFISH stands for improving the quality of fishery export and the sustainability of fishery resources. The overall objective of NETFISH is to improve sustainable livelihoods in the fisheries sector and to make concrete progress towards meeting the goals in fisheries. NETFISH has been conducting extensive outreach programmes among fishers and fishery stakeholders in all coastal States of India since its inception in 2007, and in the 12-year period a total of 27,485 extension programmes were executed successfully in areas lying in and around selected harbours and landing centres across the country. NETFISH programmes include fish quality management programmes conducted at landing sites, fishing vessels, fisher villages, pre-processing centres, processing factories and fish-drying areas. Also, awareness programmes on conservation of marine resources and sustainable fishing are conducted in fishing vessels, fishing harbours and nearby places. NETFISH also organises a variety of special programmes such as street plays, clean-up programmes, mass communication programmes, schoolchildren awareness programmes, door-to-door programmes, medical camps, sea safety and navigation training, livelihood development and skill development programmes on value addition of fishery products and square mesh fabrication. Apart from the regular quality management and conservation activities, special training and mini projects on production of hygienic dry fish, production of value-added fishery products, popularisation of square mesh cod ends, eradication of plastic from seas were also initiated by NETFISH. NETFISH developed extension tools such as posters, leaflets, manuals, documentaries and animation films in English, Hindi and eight regional languages. Meetings and discussions are held regularly between various stakeholders to resolve issues regarding fish quality management and sustainable fishing and also for the development of infrastructure facilities at harbours and landing centres. NETFISH initiatives have helped fisher communities to further enhance their skill and knowledge in fish quality management and conservation of marine resources. To encourage women entrepreneurs, NETFISH has supported the introduction of Fish Nutricart and mobile seafood kiosks in Visakhapatanam and Kochi. It is also a partner in the Kerala government’s Suchitwa Sagaram programme, which is aimed at recovering ghost nets and plastic debris from the sea. What has been NaCSA’s experience with cluster farming? Is this the model for sustainable practice in the long run? NaCSA is supporting sustainable aquaculture in India by creating a participatory movement that empowers the marginalised and poor rural aquaculture farmers through capacity-building at the grass-roots level. It is achieving this objective by organising aquaculture societies to improve information exchange and sharing of resources among group members, disseminating technologies and information on better farming practices, and through judicious use of natural resources to produce safe and sustainably farmed shrimp. The NaCSA cluster farming concept is good and this project has been appreciated by a large section of small- and medium-scale aquaculture farmers who benefited from this cluster concept. NaCSA identified 918 clusters in six States within the span of a decade. There is a lot of attention from international organisations such as the United States Food and Drug Administration [FDA], the Network of Aquaculture Centres in Asia-Pacific [NACA] and the Food and Agricultural Organisation. These organisations recognised the “participatory approach” concept in the farming community, particularly among small and marginal farmers. This section of farmers are honouring NaCSA’s better management practices [BMP] and its allied activities and adopting BMPs in their clusters to prevent disease outbreak. They experienced comparatively lesser disease outbreak than outside aquaculture farms [7 per cent in clusters whereas outside it is 15-20 per cent]. Small and marginal farmers have come forward to form clusters to adopt NaCSA’s BMP for sustainable shrimp farming. This has given good encouragement in NaCSA and the MPEDA to strengthen their activities among a larger number of aquaculture farmers in all States. These cluster concept farmers are more aware of the traceability system; food safety issues, mainly abuse of banned antibiotics in aquaculture farming; and certification norms through NaCSA training programmes and awareness campaigns. At this juncture, we don’t have any options other than the “participatory approach” to bring a level of sustainability among aquaculture primary producers. We believe that the cluster approach has shown successful results. Are exporters shying away from value-added marine products? What steps has the MPEDA taken to encourage them to add value to their products? There is great demand for seafood/seafood-based products in ready-to-eat “convenience” form. Successful value addition involves a combination of skilled manpower, ingredients, machinery and packaging, which ultimately leads to the production of high-risk products. Exporters rise to the challenges involved in the production of high-risk products. It is a fact that there is huge risk involved in the value-added products exports, which makes exporters hesitate to go for value addition. However, the MPEDA, in addition to policy and financial assistance support, also organises training programmes to develop workers’ skills for value addition. As India exports only a small quantity of value-added products, the production and export of value-added products needs to be promoted. Additional incentives, extension of interest equalisation to units engaged in value addition irrespective of their MSME status, facilitation of smoother imports of raw material and ingredients for reprocessing activities and value addition can enhance the share of value-added marine products in our export basket. Another thrust area is enhancing exports of live and chilled seafood by air to nearby markets such as West Asia and East Asia. The share of live and chilled seafood in India’s total exports is just 2 per cent compared with the world trade average of 20 per cent. What is the status of the anti-dumping duty [ADD] imposed on Indian marine products? Are there any other impediments that affect Indian exports? On the basis of a representation from the Southern Shrimp Producers Alliance, an association of shrimp producers in the U.S., the U.S. Department of Commerce initiated ADD on shrimp imports from India in 2004. The association had contended that India was selling shrimp at a price lower than that given to any other country. The initial ADD imposed was 10.17 per cent. It was reviewed subsequently. What steps has the MPEDA taken towards diversification since one species dominates exports? The MPEDA conducts awareness campaigns for farmers on the culture of different species utilising the diverse climatic and geographical conditions of the country and the vast and diverse aquatic resources available. The major species currently promoted are genetically improved farmed tilapia, mud crab, sea bass, cobia and pompano. The MPEDA also carries out demonstrations of these species in farmers’ ponds with technical support from the RGCA. These activities have created interest among farmers and entrepreneurs about the potential of the species as commercial ventures. However, the major constraint now is the lack of enough hatcheries for seed production. The MPEDA/RGCA is motivating State governments to set up hatcheries of the candidate species by assuring them of the necessary technological support. A few States have signed a memorandum of understanding in this regard. It is expected that in the next few years there will be more hatcheries to meet the seed demand."
